She came to Washington determined to put an end to the gridlock, and during her time in office she has established a record of working across the aisle to get things done for her constituents in the Granite State.  Prior to taking office, Annie served as a longtime community activist and adoption attorney who focused her career on increasing opportunity for Granite State families. A strong advocate for seniors, students, veterans, and women and their families, Annie has always been committed to fighting for the issues that matter most to Granite Staters, like increasing access to higher education and affordable health care, and cutting waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government to ensure our taxpayer dollars are used wisely. Annie played a key role in creating New Hampshire's UNIQUE College Savings Program to help parents save for their children's education, as well as the Medication Bridge Program to provide medicine to low-income families.Since taking office, Annie has prioritized efforts to facilitate the creation of good jobs and to increase economic opportunity for every New Hampshire family. Annie knows small businesses serve as the backbone of our local economy, and she's visited dozens of businesses through her Congress At Your Company series. These visits helped inform the drafting of her 2014 Middle Class Jobs and Economic Opportunity Agenda, a blueprint of legislative proposals that Annie is pushing in Congress to help New Hampshire businesses grow and create more jobs. Additionally, she hosts a series of job fairs throughout the Second District, where Granite State job seekers and employers can meet and connect.The daughter of a WWII veteran and prisoner of war, Annie is also dedicated to ensuring our nation's veterans have the support they need to make a smooth and successful transition back to civilian life. As a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Annie has pushed a number of legislative initiatives to improve the lives of veterans across the country. In 2014, she helped lead the successful fight to pass comprehensive VA reform legislation to ensure every veteran can get timely access to the health care they need, and in 2015 she was selected to serve as Ranking Member of the House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. In this position, Annie plays a lead role in overseeing the implementation of reforms at the VA, as well as identifying additional opportunities to protect taxpayers and improve services for veterans.As a lifelong Granite Stater, Annie recognizes the importance of family farms and healthy forests to our economy.  In Congress, she also serves on the House Agriculture Committee, where she has championed Granite State priorities like conserving natural resources, cutting wasteful subsidies, supporting organic farming, and fighting childhood hunger.  During her first term in office, Annie helped pass into law a bipartisan Farm Bill that included many measures she championed, including provisions to support local Granite State farms, protect wildlife habitat, promote the domestic maple syrup industry, and invest in renewable energy.  The Department of Agriculture has a broad jurisdiction over many federal programs, and Annie is focused on working with the USDA to foster economic growth in New Hampshire's rural communities.Annie is also committed to protecting the programs Granite State seniors count on, such as Medicare, Social Security, and medical research funding for diseases that affect older Americans. With her late mother, who suffered from Alzheimer's Disease, Annie coauthored a book entitled ""The Last Dance- Facing Alzheimer's with Love and Laughter."" Before taking office, Annie and her father toured the state speaking out about Alzheimer's Disease and the burdens it places on families and caregivers. In Congress, Annie has championed legislation both to increase funding for research on finding a cure to this deadly disease, and to provide vital support for caregivers who work full-time looking after their loved ones.Annie graduated from Dartmouth College in 1978 as part of the College's third class that included women students, and from Georgetown University Law Center in 1984. Annie is a member of the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, and before her election to Congress she maintained a private adoption practice in which she helped hundreds of New Hampshire families adopt children.Annie was born and raised in Concord, New Hampshire. Annie's late mother, former State Senator Susan McLane, was a pioneer for women in New Hampshire politics. Her late father, Malcolm McLane, was Mayor of Concord, a New Hampshire Executive Councilor, and one of the state's most prominent attorneys for over 50 years.Annie and her husband Brad, an environmental lawyer, now live nearby in Hopkinton where they raised their two sons, Zach and Travis."

He is a graduate of the Community College of Philadelphia and LaSalle University. One of his first jobs out of college was as a teacher in the School District of Philadelphia, shortly thereafter he became a job developer for the Urban League of Philadelphia.In 1980, at the age of 26, Congressman Evans was first elected State Representative from the 203rd Legislative District. Far from being a ""go-along-get-along"" legislator, over the course of 36 years in the Pennsylvania Legislature, he earned a reputation as a pragmatic leader who knows how to put public policy above politics.Congressman Evans made history in 1990 by becoming the first African-American Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, a position he held for two decades. In that role, he was instrumental in helping Philadelphia and communities across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania receive funding for economic development, job training, education, infrastructure and the arts.A champion for teachers and innovation in education, Congressman Evans helped start the West Oak Lane Charter School, a unionized school, which has helped teach thousands of kids from grades K-8.One of Congressman Evans proudest achievements has been his work to combat hunger and increase access to quality foods in underserved communities. During his time in the PA State Legislature, the Congressman created the Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative, which links public and private funds to expand and build grocery stores in food deserts across our state. Through the initiative the Congressman brought nearly 100 grocery stores to underserved areas across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that previously had very limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and created more than 5,000 jobs.  The Fresh Food Financing Initiative was widely recognized as one of the top public policy initiatives in the country. The Obama administration championed Congressman Evans' approach and used the Pennsylvania initiative as a model for the nation, replicating it in several other states across the country, including California, New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, and Illinois.In 2013, Congressman Evans released his political biography titled, ""Making Ideas Matter- My Life as a Policy Entrepreneur"" written with Pulitzer Prize-winning author William Ecenbarger, and published by the University of Pennsylvania's Fels Institute of Government. Over the course of his career in public service, Congressman Evans has lectured around the country on his signature public policy initiatives.

Dutch Ruppersberger is serving his eighth term in the United States House of Representatives for the citizens of Maryland's 2nd District. Congressman Ruppersberger is known as a common sense consensus builder who works with Members from both sides of the aisle to get results for Maryland and the nation.Congressman Ruppersberger currently serves on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, including the Defense, the State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs and the Homelande Security subcommittees. The Appropriations Committee is responsible for allocating hundreds of billions of federal dollars each year.The assignment comes after a committee-record 12 years serving on the House Intelligence Committee, including four as Ranking Member. Congressman Ruppersberger was the first Democratic freshman ever appointed to the committee, which oversees the collection and analysis of intelligence from around the world to ensure our national security and prevent potential crisis situations - especially terrorist activity. He traveled to more than 50 countries including Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, China and Venezuela during his time on the committee. On the committee, he developed a reputation for bipartisan leadership with then-Chairman and Republican Mike Rogers.  Beginning in 2011, the pair worked together to pass five intelligence authorization bills over four years -- after a 6-year period without one -- as well as bipartisan cybersecurity legislation.

He is working hard to help middle-class Marylanders achieve more than just making ends meet. The Congressman is also fighting to keep our country safe and get our first responders the funds they need to protect our communities and our families.A former assistant state's attorney in Baltimore County, Congressman Ruppersberger decided to run for office after a near-fatal car accident while investigating a drug trafficking case.

First sworn in as a freshman to the 93rd Congress after winning a special election on March 6, 1973, Congressman Young is today the Dean of the House Republicans and second longest serving member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Congressman Young served as Chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee from 1995 to 2001 and then as the Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee from 2001-2007.  In the 110th Congress, Representative Young returned to the helm of the Resources Committee to lead his fellow Republicans as the Ranking Member. In the 112th Congress, he was chosen to serve as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs (IIANA) - a position he held until January 2017. After fulfilling a successful 6-year term as Chairman of the IIANA Subcommittee, Congressman Young was named Chairman Emeritus of the full House Committee on Natural Resources - a role that allows him to bring his years of experience and knowledge to all five of the panel's Subcommittees. Today, Congressman Young currently serves as the most senior Republican on both the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and House Natural Resources Committee.Congressman Young calls Fort Yukon, Alaska home; a remote village of approximately 700 people located 7 miles above the Arctic Circle in Alaska's central interior region.  Born on June 9, 1933 in Meridian, California, he earned his associate degree at Yuba Junior College in 1952, and his bachelor's degree in teaching at Chico State College in 1958.  Between earning these degrees, he served in the US Army's 41st Tank Battalion from 1955 to 1957.When he first moved to Alaska, Congressman Young made a living in construction and tried his hand at commercial fishing, trapping, and in the search for gold.  In Fort Yukon he taught in a 25-student, 5th grade elementary class in the Bureau of Indian Affairs school. Constructed of logs, the school had a wood stove that kept his Alaska Native students warm in the sub-freezing, arctic winter. With the annual spring break-up of the river ice, he captained his own tug and barge operation to deliver products and supplies to villages along the Yukon River.  Even today, he remains the only licensed mariner in Congress. It was in Fort Yukon that Rep. Young met and married a young bookkeeper named Lu.  Lu was always at the Congressman's side and supported him throughout his public service career.  Lu and Don were married for 46 years.  They were blessed with and raised two daughters, Joni and Dawn, and 14 grandchildren.  Mrs. Young passed away on August 2, 2009. Although Congressman Young never imagined finding love again, on June 9, 2015 he married Anne Garland Walton, a Fairbanks-area flight nurse and proud mother of two children and six grandchildren. Congressman Young first entered public service in 1964 when he was elected Mayor of Fort Yukon.  Two years later, Alaskan voters elected him to the State Legislature in Juneau where he served in the State House from 1966 to 1970, and later in the State Senate from 1970 to 1973.  Just hours after being sworn in to United States House of Representatives in 1973, he found himself leading the historic battle for approval of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline. Often citing this as the single most important achievement in his career, Congressman Young stated, ""Next to statehood itself, the most historical legislation passed that affected every Alaskan then, now, and in the future, was the passage of the pipeline legislation.""That same year, his colleagues honored him as the ""Freshman Congressman of the Year.""  He went on to gain a key appointment on the then Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee where he pushed through the 200-mile fishing limit critical to Alaska's fishing industry.  He fought against federal control of lands and resources to which Alaskans are rightfully entitled - a battle he continues today with the same vigor.  In 1997, he passed by a 419 to 1 vote, the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act, which sets guidelines and priority uses within our nation's 550-plus wildlife refuges.Congressman Young proudly serves as the ""Congressman for All Alaska"" and loves his role as the only Alaskan Representative in Congress.  Renewed by the challenges and goals of the 115th Congress and his committee positions, Congressman Young will continue to champion legislation and funding for programs benefiting Alaska and the nation.  His vision remains the same - to provide citizens with the opportunity for a better life not just for today, but also for tomorrow and the future."

The 7th district is located just east of California's capitol city, Sacramento, and lies entirely within Sacramento County. A first-generation American born and raised in California, Bera is guided by a desire to serve his community. It's that commitment to service that led him to become a doctor and later run for Congress.Congressman Bera grew up believing America was a land of opportunity, where if you worked hard and played by the rules, you could reach your full potential. He attended California's public schools from grammar school through medical school, earning both his B.S. and M.D. from the University of California, Irvine. With help from his family, scholarships, and working part-time, he put himself through medical school while taking advantage of federally-funded student loans, and graduating with less than $10,000 in debt. He credits much of his success to his country's investment in him, and he's working to ensure that we continue to invest in hard working Americans to keep the American Dream alive for the next generation.During Congressman Bera's twenty-year medical career, he worked to improve the availability, quality, and affordability of healthcare. After graduating from medical school in 1991, he did his residency in internal medicine at California Pacific Medical Center, eventually becoming chief resident. He went on to practice medicine in the Sacramento area, serving in various leadership roles for MedClinic Medical Group. Chief among his contributions was improving the clinical efficiency of the practice. He then served as medical director of care management for Mercy Healthcare, where he developed and implemented a comprehensive care management strategy for the seven-hospital system.Congressman Bera went on to put his medical experience to work for his community, serving Sacramento County as Chief Medical Officer. In that role, he fought to reduce the cost of health care, create jobs, and deliver care to tens of thousands of Sacramento residents. He then moved into education, working as clinical professor of medicine and associate dean for admissions and outreach at University of California, Davis, where he taught the next generation of doctors. He also helped the University's student-run clinics find innovative ways to engage with the community and deliver care to those who needed it most.In Congress, Bera uses the skills he learned as a doctor to listen to the people of Sacramento County and put people ahead of politics to move our country forward. His priority is to work alongside people in both parties to address our nation's most pressing challenges and make government work. Bera believes Congress should be a place for service, not for politicians who only look out to protect their own careers, pay, and perks.That's why the first bill he introduced and helped pass was No Budget, No Pay, which says if Members of Congress don't do their jobs and pass a budget on time, they shouldn't get paid. He's now fighting to make No Budget, No Pay permanent and has repeatedly voted against congressional pay raises and has fought perks like letting Members of Congress fly on first class while having taxpayers pick up the bill. He's also a former Co-Chair of the Congressional Problem Solvers Caucus, the only bipartisan group of its kind in Washington, where both Republicans and Democrats can find common ground on the crucial challenges we all face. By working with people in both parties, he's helped secure important achievements such as the 21st Century Health Care for Heroes Act to modernize and streamline health care for veterans and to reduce the VA backlog.Congressman Bera has also made it a priority for his office to make government work for Sacramento County. His office has now helped return more than $5.2 million to local taxpayers - everything from backlogged veterans' benefits to Social Security savings. His office also has helped nearly 10,000 residents.Congressman Bera is focused on creating more jobs and opportunities in Sacramento County and helping families keep up with changes in our economy. That's why his office has held job fairs to connect unemployed workers with jobs, created a comprehensive Job Seeker Resource guide to help jobless residents, and has supported crucial infrastructure projects such as upgrading the Folsom Dam to create jobs and to improve safety.Congressman Bera is also the founder and Chair of the California Public Higher Education Caucus. As a former educator and alumnus of the UC system, Congressman Bera is committed to making college affordable for all Americans.  He is also a member of the New Democrat Coalition, a group of legislators dedicated to maintaining America's standing as the world's strongest, most successful nation.  His work with the New Dems is focused on finding ways to foster and harness American creativity and ingenuity so that it leads to new American jobs, greater economic prosperity, and a safer and more secure future for our country.Congressman Bera is the longest-serving Indian American currently serving in Congress. He has lived in Elk Grove, California for 20 years with his wife Janine, who is also a medical doctor. They are proud parents to their daughter, Sydra."

In 2013, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame at a ceremony in Seneca Falls, the birthplace of the American women's rights movement.              For 30 years, Leader Pelosi has represented San Francisco, California's 12th District, in Congress.  She has led House Democrats for more than 12 years and previously served as House Democratic Whip.Under the leadership of Pelosi, the 111th Congress was heralded as ""one of the most productive Congresses in history"" by Congressional scholar Norman Ornstein. President Barack Obama called Speaker Pelosi ""an extraordinary leader for the American people"" and the Christian Science Monitor wrote- ""make no mistake- Nancy Pelosi is the most powerful woman in American politics and the most powerful House Speaker since Sam Rayburn a half century ago.""Working in partnership with President Obama, Speaker Pelosi led House passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in early 2009 to create and save millions of American jobs, provide relief for American families, and provide a tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans. With the House Democratic Caucus, Pelosi continues to focus on the need to create jobs in America and prevent them from being shipped overseas. Speaker Pelosi achieved passage of historic health insurance reform legislation in the House which establishes a Patients' Bill of Rights and will provide insurance for tens of millions more Americans while lowering health care costs over the long term. The new law provides patients with affordable insurance choices, curbs abuses by the insurance industry, strengthens Medicare, and reduces the deficit by more than $100 billion over the next 10 years.  In the 111th Congress, Speaker Pelosi also led the Congress in passing strong Wall Street reforms to rein in big banks and protect consumers as well as the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which expands educational opportunities and reforms the financial aid system to save billions of taxpayers' dollars.

In only his second term, Gomez served as Chair of the powerful Assembly Appropriations Committee.Born and raised in Southern California, Assemblymember Gomez is the child of immigrant parents who moved to California from Mexico in the early 1970s. Often working multiple jobs just to make ends meet, his parents instilled in him a strong sense of family and work ethic.His parent's struggle of caring for family, while trying to provide in times of illness and emergency, prompted Gomez to author and pass the nation's most progressive expansion of Paid Family Leave. Assemblymember Gomez' Assembly Bill 908, which was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown and hailed as a model for Congress by President Obama, expanded California's Paid Family Leave program to work for all who pay into it and allow those on the lowest rungs of the state's economic ladder to afford the very program they are helping fund. Following the passage of AB 908, President Obama released the following statement-Strengthening families by improving access to education and healthcare and protecting the rights of workers has been a driving force behind many of Assemblymember Gomez' legislative efforts. After graduating from high school, Assemblymember Gomez found work where he could - at a fast-food restaurant and a local superstore working from 5pm to 9am the next day. After several months of working both jobs, and with the memory of his parents' struggle to make ends meet...something just clicked! He now clearly understood the need of a good job with benefits, and most importantly a quality education. With this newfound clarity, he enrolled in community college and ultimately transferred to UCLA, where he graduated magna cum laude and later earned a Master's in Public Policy from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Assemblymember Gomez recognizes that his story today, although not unique, is a lot harder to achieve and out of reach for far too many.Through legislation, Assemblymember Gomez has successfully lead efforts to increase access to higher education, promote healthy families and communities, restore the LA River, protect our environment, keep affordable housing affordable, safeguard the rights of undocumented minors, increase youth voter education and civic engagement, expand access for disabled Californians, protect patient access, increase real dollars being spent on domestic violence and sexual assault prevention programs, protect small businesses from predatory ADA lawsuits and empower local communities to stop illegal massage parlors. During the peak of California's drought, Assemblymember Gomez played a key role in negotiating and authoring the 20014 $7.5 billion Water Bond and secured $900 million ground water clean-up and $100 million specifically for LA River greening and revitalization.Assemblymember Gomez continues to pave the way for progressive legislation to elevate and promote environmental justice, education access, healthcare access and workers' rights.Prior to being elected to the Legislature, Assemblymember Gomez served as Political Director of the United Nurses Associations of California and brings with him over a decade of experience in local, state and national politics, including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), National League of Cities, Democratic National Committee, office of former L.A.

Torres represents California's 35th congressional district which includes Bloomington, Chino, Fontana, Montclair, Ontario, Pomona, and Rialto. She previously served as a State Senator, Assembly Member, and as a Mayor and Council Member in the City of Pomona. Throughout her career in elected office, Norma Torres has worked to make government more responsive to the needs of Inland Empire residents.As a State Senator, Torres played a significant role in making the Affordable Care Act work for California's patients and consumers.  She led efforts to increase access to care and improve the quality of care in underserved areas.  Her law to diversify the Covered California Board so that it is better prepared to enroll the uninsured earned her statewide recognition and national attention.  She also championed a law to generate more revenue for programs that train and place doctors in medically underserved communities.  Understanding that our healthcare system often results in many prescription drug patients paying more for treatments than is necessary, Torres passed a consumer protection law that requires health insurance companies to be more transparent in the way they present information about prescription drugs covered by their plans. During her time in the Legislature, Norma Torres also led efforts to provide financial assistance to millions of California families negatively impacted by the great recession.  As Chair of the Committee on Housing and Community Development, she led an effort that secured $2 billion in federal funds for the ""Keep Your Home California"" program which helped thousands of families keep their homes during the foreclosure crisis. She also passed the Homeowner's Bill of Rights and authored legislation to accelerate the construction of affordable housing, help delinquent homeowners refinance their second mortgages, and make it easier for returning veterans to purchase homes.Fighting crime and making sure the public safety system is responsive to the needs of the community has been a lifelong priority for Torres. As a former 9-1-1 dispatcher, she drew on her expertise to write a law that modernized our 9-1-1 system-resulting in a system that now routes cell phone callers to their local police department, rather than a statewide hotline, during an emergency. Torres also authored legislation to help prevent metal theft, keep drivers under the influence of drugs off our roads and highways, stop peeping toms from exploiting victims, and to raise fines on criminals who tamper with online data.  In response to a wave of corruption in local and state government in 2013, Torres championed anti-corruption laws that will make it easier for prosecutors to convict elected officials and individuals who receive bribes or engage in other acts of public corruption.Since coming to Congress, Torres has worked to make sure Washington is responsive to the needs of Inland Empire residents.  At the beginning of her term she launched a Job Creation Listening Tour where she met with over 200 business owners, employees, education professionals, and local economic leaders to hear straight from the community how best to foster economic growth and create jobs in the Inland Empire.  Upon completion of the tour, she released a report detailing her recommendations titled ""A Roadmap to Economic Resilience in the Inland Empire"" and has since introduced two pieces of legislation, the Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Act and the JOBS Act, based on those recommendations.Torres immigrated to the United States from Guatemala at age five and is a longtime resident of the Inland Empire.  She resides in Pomona with her husband Louis, and their sons Robert and Matthew. A proud supporter of the US military, her third son, Christopher, is a veteran of the United States Air Force.

In her first term, Congressmember Bass created the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth along with co-chair U.S. Representative Tom Marino (R-Pa.), and intends to examine national standards of care in the child welfare system.In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the Uninterrupted Scholars Act (USA) which was the first major piece of legislation shepherded through the House under the Caucus' leadership.  USA makes it easier for caregivers to access educational records so they can assist foster youth with school enrollment and provide additional academic support in an effort to reduce school dropout rates.  Since 2012, she has joined Members of the Caucus for a Nationwide Foster Youth Listening Tour traveling the nation to examine best practices and the challenging conditions that foster youth face in our country. She is also a co-chair of the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Coalition on Adoption.On Africa, Congressmember Bass acted swiftly during her first term to bring legislators, advocacy groups and international leaders together to extend the third country fabric provision of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).  The provision supports stability, development, and economic growth of sub-Saharan African countries by protecting jobs in the apparel sector and providing some of the best markets for American businesses to sell their goods and services. In an effort to be responsive to the people in her district, Congressmember Bass created the Congressional Council, which provides an opportunity for constituents to learn firsthand about the issues in Congress and how to become involved in the legislative process.

It was at that time that she made a lifetime commitment to effecting social change in her community and abroad. She worked for nearly a decade as a Physician Assistant and served as a clinical instructor at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine Physician Assistant Program.In 1990, in response to the crisis that was gripping inner-city America, which in Los Angeles was crack-cocaine and gang violence, Congressmember Bass started and ran the Community Coalition, a community-based social justice organization in South Los Angeles that empowers residents to become involved in making a difference. Through her leadership at the Community Coalition, Congressmember Bass worked to address the drug and violence epidemic and to engage community residents in addressing the root causes of injustice.Congressmember Bass had one daughter, Emilia Bass-Lechuga and son-in-law Michael Wright. She continues to be inspired by Emilia and Michael's passion for life. Emilia planned to follow in her mother's footsteps working for social change. Congressmember Bass also has four step children.She grew up with three brothers in the Venice/Fairfax area of Los Angeles and is the only daughter of DeWitt and Wilhelmina Bass.

During 14 years in the California State Assembly, she rose to the powerful position of Democratic Caucus Chair. She was responsible for some of the boldest legislation California has ever seen.As a national Democratic Party leader, Congresswoman Waters has long been highly visible in Democratic Party politics and has served on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) since 1980. She was a key leader in five presidential campaigns- Sen. Edward Kennedy (1980), Rev. Jesse Jackson (1984 & 1988), and President Bill Clinton (1992 & 1996).

He was first elected in 2012 and reelected in 2014 and 2016.Prior to joining Congress, he served a two-decade tenure as, first, a Long Beach, California city council member, then, as a California legislator. In Washington, D.C., Congressman Lowenthal has continued his dedication to common-sense bipartisan solutions that earned him a reputation among his colleagues and constituents as one of the most respected and effective legislators in both Long Beach and Sacramento.Born March 8, 1941, Congressman Alan Lowenthal was raised in the Queens Borough of New York City. After earning his Bachelor's Degree from Hobart and William Smith Colleges and his Ph.D. from Ohio State University, he moved to Long Beach, California in 1969 where he taught Community Psychology at California State University, Long Beach until 1998.Congressman Lowenthal successfully ran for Long Beach City Council in 1992, where he served for six years. He then continued his leadership in Sacramento, first serving three terms as a State Assembly member, then two terms as a State Senator.As a city council member, and then as a state legislator, the Congressman fought against the then-commonplace private and public sector belief that environmental protections and economic success at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles were mutually exclusive. His landmark environmental legislative efforts helped lead the two adjacent ports toward becoming the cleanest and greenest ports in the world, while also remaining the busiest and most successful container port complex in the Western Hemisphere. The green business model advocated by the Congressman and instituted by the two ports has become a role model for ports throughout the world.While a State Assembly member, and as a founding member of the Assembly's Bipartisan Caucus, he paved the way for creation of California's first ever independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, which took the power of redistricting out of the hands of politicians and gave it back to the people. In addition, the Congressman led legislative efforts to revamp the state's K-12 and higher education systems. He championed the College Promise Partnership Act to help K-12 students better transition to college. The passage of his Student Success Act also helped higher education students by introducing significant reforms to the state community college system that focused on increasing graduation and transfer rates. In Congress, he currently serves on the House Natural Resources Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. He is the Ranking Member of the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. As a member of Natural Resources he also serves on the Subcommittee on Federal Lands.

For example, during the 110th Congress, Rep. Rohrabacher championed the effort to boycott the 2008 Beijing Olympics by introducing a resolution to that effect emphasizing China's litany of human rights violations. Rohrabacher is also committed to securing our borders and a staunch opponent of amnesty for illegal immigrants. During his tenure as Chairman, one of his first priorities was to investigate the U.N. Oil for Food program and potential foreign influence in the Oklahoma City Bombing. Rep. Rohrabacher will continue to look into technology transfer issues, visa policies practiced by the State Department, Chinese proliferation of nuclear weapons technology as well as other volatile areas of concern such as the massive cultivation of opium poppies in Afghanistan. As a senior member of the International Relations Committee, Rohrabacher led the effort to deny Most Favored Nation trading status to Communist China, citing the rogue nation's dismal human rights record and opposition to democracy.     Rohrabacher is a strong voice for lower government spending and taxes.

His final achievement as chairman was to secure the enactment of his Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act, signed into law by President Bush on December 23, 2004. The law clears the way for small and middle-sized entrepreneurs to build commercial space passenger vehicles and bolsters private sector participation in space travel.     Rohrabacher led efforts in the 104th and 105th Congresses to restore the intellectual property rights of American inventors legislated away with the implementation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), authoring the Patent Term Restoration Act.     The 48th congressional district is the birthplace of California's Proposition 187, a reform initiative which removes illegal aliens from the state's welfare and education rolls. Rohrabacher inspired the grassroots movement and, as a principal congressional spokesman for Prop. 187, framed the debate that led to the passage of the popular measure.     Prior to his first election to Congress in 1988, Dana served as Special Assistant to President Reagan. For seven years he was one of the President's senior speechwriters. During his tenure at the White House, Rohrabacher played a pivotal role in the formulation of the Reagan Doctrine and in championing the cause of a strong national defense.

He attended elementary school locally and during his college days, he resided in Sunset Beach. Prior to joining Ronald Reagan's White House staff, he was an editorial writer for the Orange County Register. Rohrabacher was born June 21, 1947, in Coronado, California.

He also sponsored a graffiti and home rehabilitation program, known as Operation Restore, which employed homeless individuals in an effort to improve and revitalize blighted homes and neighborhoods in San Diego's urban core.When President Bill Clinton ordered an invasion of Kosovo in 1999 to end a terrifying regime of ""ethnic cleansing"" Juan and Adrienne answered the President's call to duty and took in a refugee Kosovar family into their home for nearly two years.  The family is now thriving and independent, residing in the city of El Cajon.In 2000, Juan was elected by a wide margin to the California State Assembly. As the State Representative to the 79th Assembly District, Juan represented the southern portion of San Diego, the western portion of Chula Vista, and the cities of Coronado, Imperial Beach, and National City. In his first year as a State Legislator, Juan was appointed Assistant Majority Leader.Following the end of his term the State Assembly in 2006, Juan went on to serve as Vice President of External Affairs for Safeco Insurance and Vice President of Corporate Legal for Liberty Mutual Group.  Both are home, auto, and small business insurance companies and, under these roles, he helped bring jobs to Southern California communities.In 2010, Juan answered the call to return to public service and was elected to the California State Senate.

I spent a lot of my childhood crisscrossing the country with my parents, staying in motels and selling posters out of a pick-up truck. Eventually, my mom and dad had the idea to combine their talents - his painting and her poetry - in the form of greeting cards, which they turned into a small Colorado business called Blue Mountain Arts.I'm an entrepreneur. I've started several successful businesses and will bring that start-up vision and energy to our state government. From my college dorm room, I launched American Information Systems, a dial-up service provider that brought the internet into many homes for the first time. I also helped take the family greeting card business online, and founded ProFlowers, a true startup where I did everything from loading the trucks the night before Valentine's Day to taking the business public. Later, I co-founded Techstars, a startup accelerator where I mentored entrepreneurs from all walks of life, and Patriot Boot Camp, which helps veterans start their own small businesses after coming home from their service. I've seen first-hand how small businesses can create jobs and improve our communities, and was humbled to be honored with the ""Entrepreneur of the Year"" award for these efforts.I'm committed to providing every child a great education. I've spent most of my adult life working to improve our schools. In a statewide election in 2000, I was elected to the Colorado Board of Education. As chairman of the board, I fought to raise pay for teachers while reducing class size for students. I also founded several non-profit public schools for at-risk children and served as superintendent of the New America School, which helps new immigrants earn their high school diploma. I believe it's time for us to stop talking about investing in our children and start actually doing it.I'm the U.S. Representative for northern Colorado. I proudly stood with President Barack Obama to pass landmark health care reform, rein in the excesses of Wall Street, provide more opportunities to young immigrants, and protect our iconic public lands.

At age seventeen, after finishing his junior year at Aurora Central High School in 1972, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. Through the Army, Coffman was able to earn a high school diploma. In 1974, he left active duty to attend the University of Colorado under the G.I. Bill where he continued his military career by serving in the U.S. Army Reserve. Coffman took a leave of absence from the U.S. Army Reserve and the University of Colorado to attend D.G. Vaishnav College in Chennai, India in 1976 and the University of Veracruz in Xalapa, Mexico in 1977. Coffman graduated from the University of Colorado in 1979 and immediately transferred from the U.S. Army Reserve to the U.S. Marine Corps where he served as an infantry officer.In 1983, Coffman came back home to Colorado and started a small business, an Aurora-based property management company, that would grow to over 20 employees. He remained the senior share holder of the firm for the next seventeen years until selling his interest in 2000. While in business, he continued serving in the military by joining the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve.In his role as a Colorado small business owner, Coffman saw the need to bring more common sense pro-growth economic policies to state government so he ran and was elected to the State House of Representatives in 1988 and re-elected in 1990. Shortly after his 1990 re-election, Coffman took an unpaid leave of absence from the state legislature and volunteered to return to active duty for the first Gulf War where he served as the executive officer for a light armored infantry company. The battalion that Coffman served in was ordered to attack and defend positions inside of Kuwait, for three consecutive days prior to the main ground attack, as part of a deception and reconnaissance-by-fire operation. Coffman retired from the military in 1994 after having served for seven years between the U.S. Army and the Army Reserve and thirteen years between the U.S. Marine Corps and the Marine Corps Reserve.In 1994, Coffman was elected to the State Senate where he served as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. While in the State Senate, he completed the Senior Executive Program for State and Local Government at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. In 1998, Coffman was elected to the office of State Treasurer and re-elected in 2002. In 2005, the U.S. Marine Corps was under strength in meeting their requirements for the Iraq War and begun to extend Marines beyond their active duty enlistments, recall Marines recently released from active duty, and selectively reach out to retired Marines and request their return to active duty. Coffman resigned his position as the State Treasurer and volunteered to return to the U.S. Marine Corps for an assignment in Iraq. In Iraq, Coffman was a civil affairs officer where he worked in support of the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IECI) in 2005 and in 2006 he was reassigned to help establish interim local governments in the Western Euphrates River Valley.In 2006, Coffman came home after completing a full tour of duty in Iraq and was appointed by Governor Bill Owens to serve out the remainder of his term as the State Treasurer. In that same year, he ran and was elected to the Office of Secretary of State and served in that capacity until he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008.Coffman is the only veteran in the Colorado delegation and the only Member of Congress to have served in both Iraq Wars.

Larson proudly represents Connecticut's First District. Now in his tenth term, John sits on the influential House Ways and Means Committee-including the Subcommittees on Tax Policy and Social Security, where he serves as the Ranking Member. Throughout his time in Congress, John has proven himself a staunch advocate for Connecticut's working families, our manufacturing and small business ecosystem, and commonsense solutions for the problems Americans face everyday.Before entering Congress, John taught history and coached football at George J. Penney High School. He was also an owner of Larson & Lysik insurance company, where he saw firsthand the challenges many small business owners must overcome. Following in his mother's footsteps,  serving on the East Hartford Board of Education and the East Hartford Town Council. In 1982, he was elected to the Connecticut State Senate, beginning a 12-year tenure representing the 3rd Senate District until 1995. Larson served as Senate President Pro Tempore for eight years from 1987 to 1995. During his tenure in the Connecticut State Senate, John authored and passed the nation's first Family Medical Leave Act. It would later serve as the model for a national law. As one of eight children raised by working parents, John knew how critical it was for working families to get the support they needed. No parent should ever have to choose between their job and their child. That's why John supports expanding his original vision and providing paid family leave. First elected to Congress in 1998, John swiftly established himself as a leader and consensus builder. As the Hartford Courant has said, ""in a badly polarized Congress, [John] is more than willing to work with Republicans to get something done."" Recently John won an important victory on research and development, and righted a grave wrong in our tax code for those who have been wrongfully convicted of crimes.John knows manufacturing is the lifeblood of Connecticut's First District-thanks in large part to the historic Colt Factory. For more than a decade, John fought to preserve the legacy of American innovation and manufacturing that is Coltsville, and in 2014 he succeeded in securing Coltsville's designation as a National Historical Park. John formerly served on the Armed Services Committee, Science Committee, and as Ranking Member of the House Administration Committee. As a senior leader in the House Democratic Caucus, John was named chairman of the Task Force on Election Reform-created to develop  reforms to take big money out of politics and address flaws in the electoral system. He continues to champion much-needed reforms to address the impact of Citizens United and the gutting of the Voting Rights Act.Taking a StandChange doesn't come swiftly to Washington, but John knows some things are too important to delay. As the nation continues to battle an epidemic of gun violence, John has called on Congress to vote on bipartisan reforms most Americans overwhelmingly support. He considers it unconscionable that even in the light of tragedies like Sandy Hook and the high levels of gun violence in urban centers like Hartford, Congress has yet to even hold a vote. Frustrated by the continues silence in Congress while Americans were crying out for action, John helped organize the historic sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives. John has been a leader throughout his tenure in Congress, on every issue he tackles. He has championed the effort to end U.S. dependence of foreign oil through advancing domestic fuel cell technology. He knows these initiatives will do more than keep our planet clean, they will spark new growth for our economy and launch thousands of exciting new jobs. That's why John introduced the Energy Independence Act, the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Authorization Act, and the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Infrastructure for America Act to fund and promote fuel cell and hydrogen energy technology. He is also a founder and co-chair of the House Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Coalition.John stands up for those who need a champion. When he heard retirees in his district were living on $11,000 a year or less, he knew he had to act to keep anyone from retiring into poverty again. So he introduced the Social Security 2100 Act to enhance benefits and ensure the foundation of our retirement system remains strong for generations. John has also introduced proposals to allow the federal government to directly negotiate lower drug prices for over 40 million Medicare beneficiaries.Among his efforts to promote development in Hartford, John hosted a delegation of community leaders from the impoverished 06120 zip code in Washington. John helped these residents of Hartford's Promise Zone meet directly with the agencies and offices now aligned to support them. He also introduced the Promise Zone Job Creation Act to encourage employers to bring more jobs into places like Hartford's North End.  Over the years, John has opposed the policies of preemption and unilateralism. He spoke out against the war in Iraq since its inception, and has focused his concerns on the threats of terrorism, protecting the homeland, and supporting first responders. A vigorous supporter of our troops, John visited Iraq three times, and succeeded in passing legislation to reimburse family members who purchased body armor for soldiers who had not been adequately equipped by the military. John also won a key victory for military families with children on the autism spectrum, ensuring their kids receive the care they need. He is a lifelong resident of East Hartford, where he lives with his wife Leslie. They have three children- Carolyn, Laura, and Raymond."

Rosa serves in the Democratic leadership as Co-Chair of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, and she is the Ranking Member on the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, where she oversees our nation's investments in education, health, and employment. Rosa also serves on the subcommittee responsible for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, where she oversees food and drug safety.At the core of Rosa's work is her fight for America's working families. Rosa believes that we must raise the nation's minimum wage, give all employees access to paid sick days, allow employees to take paid family and medical leave, and ensure equal pay for equal work. Every day, Rosa fights for legislation that would give all working families an opportunity to succeed.Rosa believes that our first priority must be to strengthen the economy and create good middle class jobs. She supports tax cuts for working and middle class families, fought to expand the Child Tax Credit to provide tax relief to millions of families, and introduced the Young Child Tax Credit to give families with young children an economic lift.Rosa has also fought to stop trade agreements that lower wages and ships jobs overseas, while also protecting the rights of employees and unions. She believes that we need to grow our economy by making smart innovative investments in our infrastructure, which is why she introduced legislation to create a National Infrastructure bank.Rosa is a leader in fighting to improve and expand federal support for child nutrition and for modernizing our food safety system. She believes that the U.S. should have one agency assigned the responsibility for food safety, rather than the 15 different agencies that lay claim to different parts of our food system.

Rosa supports a transformation in how the Department of Veterans Affairs is funded, including advanced appropriations for health services, to ensure its fiscal soundness; and she successfully championed legislation to guarantee that troops deploying to combat theaters get the mental health screening they need both before and after deployment, as well as championed legislation that now provides assistance to today's Post-9/11 veterans choosing to pursue on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs.Rosa belongs to 62 House caucus groups and is the co-chair of the Baby Caucus, the Long Island Sound Caucus, and the Food Safety Caucus.Soon after earning degrees from Marymount College and Columbia University, Rosa followed her parents' footsteps into public service, serving as the first Executive Director of EMILY's List, a national organization dedicated to increasing the number of women in elected office; Executive Director of Countdown '87, the national campaign that successfully stopped U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras; and as Chief of Staff to U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd. In 1990, Rosa was elected to the House of Representatives, and she has served as the Congresswoman from Connecticut's Third Congressional District ever since.Rosa is married to Stanley Greenberg, founding partner of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a public issues research firm. Their children-Anna, Kathryn, and Jonathan Greenberg-all are grown and pursuing careers. Rosa and Stan have six grandchildren, Rigby, Teo, Sadie, Jasper, Noah and Gus."

Since first being elected to the House in 2004, she has earned the trust of her constituents and praise on Capitol Hill for her hard work, conservative principles, bipartisan outreach, and leadership. As someone who grew up on an orchard, worked at her family's small business, and later became a wife and mom of three, McMorris Rodgers has lived the American Dream, and she works every day to rebuild that Dream for our children and grandchildren.As Chair of the House Republican Conference, she is the fourth highest-ranking Republican in the House and the highest-ranking woman in Congress. She is also the longest-serving woman in Republican leadership, and in November of 2016 she was appointed to serve as a vice chair of President-elect Trump's Transition Team. Her mission is to restore the people's voice in Congress, and to make government more efficient, effective, and accountable to hardworking Americans.A longtime advocate for members of the military and their families, McMorris Rodgers co-founded the bipartisan Military Family Caucus to provide military spouses and children a voice in Congress. She is also the co-chair of the Mobility Air Forces Caucus that advocates for the critical roles that air refueling, airlift and aero medical evacuation play in our national security. As a strong advocate for veterans, McMorris Rodgers leads the charge in Congress to ensure our veterans have access to the best healthcare available.  Her most recent legislation, the Faster Care for Veterans Act (H.R. 4352), requires the VA to adopt technology that allows veterans to schedule appointments online. It was signed into law by President Obama in December 2016.In June 2016, McMorris Rodgers developed draft legislation, the Caring for Our Heroes in the 21st Century Act, that puts veterans in charge of their healthcare by allowing them to seek care at providers of their choosing.As a native of one of the most agriculture-intensive districts in the country, McMorris Rodgers has long been an advocate for Eastern Washington's farmers.

The legislation funds the discovery, development, and delivery of life-saving cures, and includes provisions that specifically benefit the people of Eastern Washington, such as funding for better rural health programs and support for Washington State University's research on bacteria resistance to antibiotics. The bill was signed into law by President Obama in December 2016.McMorris Rodgers is a champion for the disability community. In 2014, she played an instrumental role in securing final passage of the ABLE Act, which was later described as the most comprehensive piece of disability legislation since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. McMorris Rodgers believes emphasis should be on one's ability - not disability - and that a job is more than just a way to earn money; it gives a person dignity and purpose in their life. She is dedicated to helping those with disabilities live their lives to the fullest.McMorris Rodgers believes that restoring the people's voice in Congress starts with ensuring taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and effectively.  In March 2016, she introduced the Unauthorized Spending Accountability Act (USA Act).McMorris Rodgers is the co-chair of eight Congressional caucuses- Military Family, Down Syndrome, Lumber, Neuroscience, Hydropower, Northwest Energy, Rural Health Caucus, and the Mobility Air Forces Caucus.In January 2014, McMorris Rodgers delivered the Republican address following the State of the Union, in which she articulated a hopeful, bold Republican vision that will make life better for the American people.In 2006, McMorris Rodgers married Brian Rodgers, a Spokane native and retired 26-year Navy Commander.

As the dad of two little girls, he is working to make sure all our children receive a quality education. He is committed to honoring our promises to seniors by protecting Social Security and Medicare. Derek grew up on the Olympic Peninsula and has worked to promote local economic development and to be responsible stewards of our natural resources. Born and raised in Port Angeles, Derek saw firsthand how the region's economy has struggled, and the impact that has had on families and communities. The son of two school teachers, Derek was taught to appreciate the value of education. Derek wanted to make a difference in his community, so he chose to study public policy, looking for ways to help economically struggling communities. He received a BA from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and earned a doctorate from the University of Oxford in England.Derek put his education into practice right here in Washington, first as a business consultant for McKinsey & Company, where he helped businesses, non-profits, and government agencies run more efficiently. He moved closer to the community he was raised in so he could put his experience in economic development to use helping to retain jobs and attract new employers during the decade he worked for the Economic Development Board for Tacoma-Pierce County.After seeing how the decisions that government made affected employers in our region, Derek decided to put his experience to work in Olympia. He served in the Washington state House from 2005 to 2007 and the state Senate from 2007 until he was elected to the US House in 2012. While in Olympia, Derek was the principal writer of the state's capital budget, and helped author a bipartisan infrastructure package that has been credited with creating 18,000 jobs.

As a native of the Olympic Peninsula, Derek knows the important role that natural resources play in our region, and is committed to protecting our waters and improving the health of our forests. It's also why he helped found the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus to bring increased focus and attention to the cleanup work that needs to be done to restore our region's waters.Derek has learned that addressing the challenges facing our nation will require an end to political brinkmanship and a focus on finding common sense, practical solutions.

She is proud of the district's role in leading the country on issues like the minimum wage, racial equity and innovation, and will work to support that work and lift it up as a model for the rest of the country.Her focus is on ensuring income equality; access to education, from early learning to higher education, including debt-free college; expanding Social Security and Medicare; protecting our environment for our next generation; and ensuring immigrant, civil and human rights for all.Jayapal will relentlessly challenge systems that corrupt our democracy, pushing for campaign finance reform, tax reform, voting rights and an end to institutionalized racism. In all of these endeavors, she'll continue to build the movement to expand our democracy and create the political space for policy change that benefits working families and responsible businesses.The first Indian-American woman in the House of Representatives, Jayapal has spent the last twenty years working internationally and domestically as a leading national advocate for women's, immigrant, civil, and human rights.She came to the United States by herself at the age of 16 to attend college at Georgetown University and later received her MBA from Northwestern University. She has worked in a number of industries in both the public and private sector.International Public Health and Development-Jayapal began working in international public health in 1991 at Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), a nonprofit based in Seattle. At PATH, she served for several years as the director of the Fund for Technology Transfer, a loan fund that had tremendous success in providing capital for socially responsible health projects, including primary health clinics, small businesses, and micro-credit programs across Africa, Latin America and Asia. Jayapal went on to become a Fellow of the Institute of Current World Affairs, living for two years in villages and small towns across her birth country of India, exploring development issues. She published her first book in 2000, Pilgrimage to India- A Woman Revisits Her Homeland.Immigrant, Civil and Human Rights and Economic Justice-After the September 11, 2001 attacks, and in the wake of discrimination and civil liberties abuses against Muslims, Arabs and South Asians, Jayapal founded the nonprofit Hate Free Zone (now OneAmerica). She served as Executive Director for 11 years, growing the organization to be the largest immigrant advocacy organization in Washington state and one of the largest in the country. Under her leadership, OneAmerica successfully worked to sue the George W. Bush administration to stop the deportations of thousands of Somalis across the country; to help end Special Registration of Muslims and Arabs; and to lead the fight for comprehensive immigration reform. OneAmerica also led the effort to establish an Office of Immigrant & Refugee Affairs in Seattle, and to make Seattle one of the first cities to ban asking about immigration status by law enforcement or city officials. At the state level, OneAmerica was at the forefront of the effort to preserve drivers licenses for all, regardless of citizenship status, in Washington state, and to promote immigrant integration. In 2009, Jayapal was named by Governor Christine Gregoire as Vice Chair of the state's New Americans Policy Council. OneAmerica also led one of the largest voter registration efforts in Washington state, helping more than 23,000 new Americans register to vote.Jayapal went on to lead the national coalition, We Belong Together, to bring a gender lens to immigration reform. The coalition played a key part in adding important provisions in the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill that ultimately passed the U.S. Senate with 68 bipartisan votes, but was stalled in the House.She was appointed by Seattle Mayor Ed Murray to the Income Inequality Committee that crafted the successful legislation to raise the city's minimum wage to $15.

Adam was raised in SeaTac, Washington where his father, Ben, worked as a ramp serviceman at SeaTac Airport and was active in the local Machinists' Union. His mother, Leila, stayed at home, raising Adam and his two brothers. Adam attended Bow Lake Elementary, Chinook Middle School, and Tyee High School, graduating from Tyee in 1983.After a year at Western Washington University, Adam transferred to Fordham University, where he worked his way through college loading trucks for United Parcel Service and graduated in 1987 with a degree in Political Science. Following his graduation, Adam attended the University Of Washington School Of Law, and earned his law degree in 1990. He later worked in both private and public practice, first as a lawyer at Cromwell, Mendoza and Belur in 1992, and then as a prosecutor for the City of Seattle from 1993-1995. As a prosecutor, Adam focused on drunk driving and domestic violence cases, and in 1996, went on to work as a judge pro tempore.During his final year at UW, Adam decided to run for the State Senate in the 33rd Legislative District, where he grew up. He campaigned door to door, eventually doorbelling the entire district twice and defeating the 16 year incumbent in the 1990 election. When he took office in January 1991, Adam was 25 years old and the youngest State Senator in the country. While in the State Senate, Adam served on the Education and Law and Justice Committees, and served as Chair of the Law and Justice Committee from 1993-1997. Despite the strong Republican tide in 1994, Adam was re-elected to the State Senate in 1994 and his victory helped the Democrats retain control of the State Senate by one seat. During his time in the State Senate, Adam developed a reputation for having a thoughtful and common sense approach to governance.As our economy recovers from the Great Recession, it is clear that middle and working-class families no longer have access to the same opportunities that they did just a decade ago.  A central driver of this ""squeezing out"" effect is income inequality, which is now as high as it's been since the 1930s. Adam's top priority is to encourage broad-based economic opportunity by ensuring all Americans have access to a high-quality education and job-training opportunities, building a stronger transportation infrastructure, reforming our tax code, and supporting social programs that provide a bridge for struggling families to get back to work. These efforts are necessary to restore the American Dream with a pathway to a middle class life for American families.Adam also understands the importance of passing comprehensive immigration reform.  He has been a strong voice in Congress advocating for the House of Representatives to pass legislation that creates a pathway to citizenship.  For too long our immigration system has been broken and it continues to rip families apart. Adam has also been leader in advocating for new legislation and policy changes to reform deportation and detention policies.  Now in his 11th term, Adam serves as Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee, where he is a strong advocate for our military personnel and their families. Adam is also committed to providing our military personnel with the best equipment available to carry out their current and future missions while ensuring that the Pentagon spends taxpayer dollars in the most efficient and effective manner. This includes carefully examining our current policies and working to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse.  Having served on the on the House Armed Services Committee since 1997, Adam formerly chaired the subcommittee on Air and Land Forces (ALF), which has jurisdiction over all Army and nearly all Air Force acquisition programs. Prior to serving as Chair of ALF, Adam chaired the Terrorism, Unconventional Threats and Capabilities subcommittee, which oversees the United States Special Operations Forces and counter-terrorism policy, among other critical areas. Adam has also previously served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.Given his current and previous committee assignments and extensive travel, Adam has unique insights into today's foremost national security issues throughout the Middle East, including the war in Afghanistan, as well as Northern Africa and our larger efforts to stop the spread of violent extremist groups and their ideology around the globe. Understanding the need for a holistic approach to national security, Adam recognizes the importance of poverty reduction, access to education, sustainable global markets, diplomatic engagement, good governance and other measures to enable our pursuit of stable international partners.  As such, he has been a long-time advocate of strengthening American diplomacy and development as well as defense.Congressman Smith sees a clear need to reform our foreign assistance and improve these two pillars of national security that have been under-resourced and underutilized for too long. He has supported efforts to reform American foreign assistance, introduced legislation to address global poverty, and created the bipartisan Congressional Caucus for Effective Foreign Assistance (CCEFA) with Congressman Ander Crenshaw.In 1993, Adam married Spokane native, Sara Bickle-Eldridge, a graduate of the University of Washington and Seattle University School of Law. Their daughter, Kendall Charlotte, was born in July 2000, followed by their son, Jack Evers, in June 2003. The Smiths live in Bellevue, where their children attend Issaquah Middle School and Issaquah High School, and participate in local sports leagues and school clubs.  Both Adam and Sara are involved in their community and their children's schools, with their highlights being Adam's stint as a recreational soccer coach and Sara's two terms as PTA President."

He was born in Fairfield in 1954, to a U.S. Steel worker and a stay-at-home mom. He grew up in Alabama during a period of great change, and played a critical part of helping the state and her people overcome some of their darkest days. His early years forged his values and a deep sense of responsibility to treat everyone with dignity and respect.  As a product and life-long resident of the state, Senator Jones represents the best qualities of what it means to be an Alabamian. The Senator grew up during the tumultuous era of the desegregation of Alabama's public schools. But from childhood, he was drawn to both leadership and to fighting for what was right.  He also found a love for politics and organizing. Through volunteering - campus affairs at Alabama, a statewide campaign to modernize Alabama's court system, and Young Democrats - the power of one, determined young person became clear to him. He later served as the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama beginning in 1997. It was while serving in this position that Senator Jones successfully prosecuted two of the four men responsible for the 16th street church bombings - finally getting justice for the four little girls after more than 30 years.  Along with taking on the Ku Klux Klan, he prosecuted terrorists like Eric Rudolph, and many others who sought to use fear, hatred, and violence to inhibit the rights of others.Senator Jones took that same passion with him when he ran in the 2017 Special Senate Election in Alabama and became the first Democratic senator elected from the state in 25 years. He understands that public service is a privilege that comes with the responsibility of making the country better for all Americans, not just those who look like us or agree with our politics. He will continue to fight for every Alabamian in the Senate to increase affordable access to healthcare and to make sure that every child has access to a quality education regardless of what zip code they live in.COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTSWashington D.C. - It was announced today that Senator Doug Jones (D-AL) has been appointed to the following four Senate Committees- the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP); the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; and, the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging. ""It is a tremendous honor to be given the opportunity to serve on these four important Senate committees"" said Senator Jones. ""These assignments provide me with an avenue to begin working for the people of Alabama on issues such as creating long-term funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program and ensuring our nation's safety from those who would do us harm.

He graduated from the Southern College of Optometry in 1977 and entered private practice that same year co-founding a family business with his brother that would ultimately become a major provider of eye care to Northwest Arkansas. John serves on five committees and chairs two subcommittees in the 114th Congress. John also serves on the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, commonly referred to as the Helsinki Commission, and the Congressional Study Group on Europe (CSGE), a bipartisan organization dedicated to frank and candid dialogue between American lawmakers and their peers in European capitals and Brussels. John's main legislative priority remains getting Arkansas's economy back on track. Since agriculture accounts for nearly one-quarter of Arkansas's economic activity, John has used his seat on the Agriculture Committee to fight for an equitable farm bill to ensure that Arkansas's farmers, ranchers and loggers are protected. While an equitable farm bill is one way that the federal government can help Arkansas's farmers, over-regulating is one way it can harm them. For that reason, John focuses his work on the EPW Committee to limit the size and intrusiveness of the federal government to help. And in this particularly difficult economy, John remains committed to providing our veterans with economic opportunities to ensure they can assume their rightful role as an indispensable part of America's work force. Prior to serving in the Senate, John represented the people of the Third District of Arkansas in the U.S. House of Representatives for five terms where he established a reputation as an advocate for Arkansas, especially our state's veterans for whom he passed legislation to improve the transition to civilian life, expand treatments for our wounded warriors and modern educational benefits under the GI Bill.

Along with Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, Chris founded and leads the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, which aims to strengthen local, state, and federal public safety efforts and improve police-community relations. Chris also worked with Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia to establish the Senate Chicken Caucus, through which the Senators helped persuade South Africa to eliminate longstanding barriers to U.S. poultry imports for the first time in 15 years.Having spent eight years working in the private sector for an advanced materials manufacturing company in Delaware, Chris knows firsthand how important intellectual property protections are to promoting investments in breakthrough technologies and cures. On the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chris has fought to strengthen and modernize our nation's patent system and establish new protections for American inventions and innovations.Chris knows that Delaware can't reach its economic potential at home if we don't maintain American leadership throughout the world. That's why he's used his position on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to advocate for key foreign policy and national security priorities, from calling for Congress to declare war on ISIS to keeping rogue nations like Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Chris knows that a safe and secure world depends on clear-eyed American leadership - and he is confident that we can keep our country safe without jeopardizing our fundamental values.A member of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Policy, Chris has emerged as an important voice on the continent's security challenges and economic opportunities. He is focused on building partnerships throughout Africa and ensuring that health programs, food aid, economic development, and security assistance effectively reach those who need it most. Chris has worked to improve access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa; engage businesses in expanded trade and investment opportunities; end preventable maternal and child deaths; protect wildlife from trafficking; and promote peace, democracy, and human rights across the continent.In the fall of 2015, Chris brought business and nonprofit leaders from around the world to Wilmington as part of his fourth annual ""Opportunity- Africa"" conference, which seeks to promote trade and investment between the U.S. and Africa. Chris' commitment to the continent stems from his interest in African affairs that began long before he became a U.S. Senator. In college, Chris spent a semester studying at the University of Nairobi in Kenya. He returned to the continent in the late 1980s to work with the South African Council of Churches in the anti-apartheid movement.Chris' election to the Senate in 2010 capped a decade of successful service in New Castle County government. In four years as New Castle County Council President and six years as New Castle County Executive, Chris earned a reputation for delivering real results on behalf of Delawareans and supporting the county during the least stable economic climate in decades. Chris balanced six budgets by eliminating wasteful spending and created jobs through innovative public-private partnerships. His Safe Streets partnership removed dangerous parole violators from Delaware neighborhoods and cleaned up dozens of the worst county properties. He also preserved thousands of acres of open space and fought for an independent ethics commission to make county government more transparent.Prior to serving as County Executive, Chris worked as an attorney for Delaware-based W.L.

I also understand our laws and government's policies can make it easier - or harder - for your family to pursue and achieve the American Dream.My office and I are here to help. During my first term in the Senate, we resolved more than 30,000 cases for constituents who sought our help with various issues, and we logged over 1,000 mobile office hours to reach Floridians in every corner of the state. We are proud of these accomplishments and hope to continue this success in my second term.  I'm passionate about serving people because I know how individuals can get lost in the federal government's bureaucracy when they seek assistance with their veterans' benefits, Social Security or Medicare, or another federal service. I've seen how a broken federal housing inspections process endangers the health and safety of people I represent.Today, many people worry that the American Dream is slipping away from their reach, and that their children and grandchildren won't be better off than they were. I'm committed to not letting that happen. I believe in the American Dream because I've lived it. My parents came to America from Cuba in 1956 and earned their way to the middle class working humble jobs - my father as a bartender in hotels and my mom as a maid, cashier and stock clerk. By their loving and powerful example, I learned the importance of family and hard work, and believed all things are possible in America.I have spent most of my life in West Miami, and live there today with my wife Jeanette and our four children. One of the many reasons I love living in Florida and representing its people are the diverse backgrounds and stories of those in my community. Some have made it in America, others are just starting out, and many more are trying to make it. There are homes led by heroic single parents or grandparents, homes with two hardworking parents, and homes with multiple generations living together.For as long as I can remember, my neighbors helped shape my impression of the American Dream, and it wasn't long after I earned my bachelor's degree from the University of Florida in 1993 and my juris doctor from the University of Miami Law School in 1996 that I felt drawn to serve them in public office.I started as a City Commissioner for West Miami before being elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000, and then speaker in November 2006. Before taking this post, I authored the book 100 Innovative Ideas for Florida's Future, which was based on conversations I had with Floridians at ""idearaisers"" that my colleagues and I hosted around the state. As speaker, I helped enact many of the ideas in this book.I was proud to be a champion for smarter, limited government at the state level, but after seeing the impact of our successes there, I wanted to take my ideas for conservative reform to where they were needed the most- Washington, D.C.When I launched my campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2009, I was expected to lose big to my better-funded and better-known Republican primary opponent. But with a come-from-behind victory, the people of Florida elected me on the promise of bringing conservative ideas to the United States Senate.Since arriving in the Senate in January 2011, I've fought against the Washington establishment's big government vision, supported replacing ObamaCare with a better health care system, and opposed bloated budgets that increased taxpayer debt at the expense of creating jobs and real prosperity.With my assignments on the Special Committee on Aging, the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Select Committee on Intelligence, and the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I'm focused on reforming our government and keeping Americans safe. I will continue to work with members of both parties on commonsense solutions, and whenever necessary, stand alone as a check and balance. That's how our Founding Fathers envisioned the Senate.In addition to the unique federal issues affecting Florida, some of my top priorities include fighting poverty by encouraging states to empower their people, bringing affordable higher education within reach of every American, sparking economic growth by capitalizing on innovation and the global economy, improving Social Security and Medicare for seniors and saving these programs for future generations, and defending our families by revitalizing America's military strength.I'm proud to serve you in the Senate. Please don't hesitate to contact me with your ideas and views on how government can work more effectively."

He is the first Georgian ever to have been elected to the state House, state Senate, U.S. House and U.S. Senate. In 2016, he became the first Republican in Georgia to be elected to a third term in the U.S. Senate.Isakson began his business career in 1967 when he opened the first Cobb County office of a small, family-owned real estate business, Northside Realty. During Isakson's 20 years as president of Northside, the company grew into the largest independent residential real estate brokerage company in the Southeast and one of the largest in America.Isakson entered politics in 1974 and served for 17 years in the Georgia legislature in both the House and Senate. In 1997, then-Gov. Zell Miller appointed Isakson to lead of the Georgia Board of Education as chairman. Isakson was elected in 1999 to the U.S. House for the first of three terms. In 2004, he was elected to his first term in the U.S. Senate, and he won re-election in 2010 and 2016.Isakson brings commonsense leadership to Congress through his bipartisan efforts to address federal spending, reduce the debt, create jobs and reform burdensome federal regulations.  Since becoming chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs (VA) in 2015, Isakson has worked tirelessly to bring oversight and accountability to the agency responsible for providing care and support to our nation's veterans. A veteran himself, Isakson has been a member of the Senate VA Committee since he joined the Senate in 2005 and played a crucial role in the massive VA reform bill, the Veterans' Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014. Georgia is home to more than a dozen military bases, as well as to more than 750,000 veterans. In addition to aiding veterans, Isakson also has worked to strengthen our armed forces and has shown unwavering commitment to the men and women serving our country today.Isakson is also chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics and takes very seriously his role in maintaining the integrity of the U.S. Senate.Isakson is a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, which has jurisdiction over taxes, trade, Medicare and Social Security. Isakson has worked to help Americans better prepare for retirement and plan ahead financially to ensure their retirement savings don't run dry, including introducing the Lifetime Income Disclosure Act. Isakson has provided a businessman's perspective on the Finance Committee and will play a key role in the debate over how to reform the nation's broken tax system.Isakson has also introduced the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act to end reckless spending and reform the federal budget process by converting it from an annual spending spree to a two-year cycle, with one year for appropriating federal dollars and the other year devoted to much-needed oversight of federal programs.Isakson also continues to serve as a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations where he has led reforms to foreign assistance programs to enhance economic growth and bolster U.S. national security, including with his Global Food Security Act of 2016 to address global hunger. He continues to work on reforms to programs such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation and Power Africa by working for streamlined processes, better monitoring and evaluation, and more private sector involvement. Additionally, Isakson remains in close coordination with the Peace Corps following the passage of his Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act of 2011 that provides better security and protection measures for Peace Corps volunteers. The law is named in memory of a Peace Corps volunteer from Georgia who was tragically murdered during her service.In 2015, after years of work on behalf of the American victims of the Iran hostage crisis, Isakson was successful in securing their compensation through the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund. The 52 Americans - including three Georgia residents - were held captive in Iran for 444 terrifying days in 1979-81.On the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Isakson maintains his career-long commitment to improving education. He played a key role in two reforms of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act; the first of which brought greater transparency to student success and the second of which returned control to local schools and parents. On labor issues, Isakson has used his business experience to seek the right balance on the critical labor issues facing employers and workers. In 2014, his bipartisan, bicameral Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act was signed into law to modernize, streamline and improve existing federal workforce development programs and to provide increased flexibility for states and local workforce boards by reducing burdensome federal mandates and strengthening accountability.In healthcare, Isakson has fought to repeal and replace Obamacare, which has increased costs and decreased access to health care. He has fought for patient-focused health care reform and patient-focused, quality, affordable health care. In 2016, Isakson successfully included a number of his health priorities in the 21st Century Cures Act, a comprehensive medical research and innovation bill that will spur the development of medical treatments and cures. Isakson also championed creating Medicare coverage for home infusion therapy services. Isakson graduated from UGA in 1966 and served in the Georgia Air National Guard from 1966 to 1972. He and his wife Dianne married in 1968 and have three children and eight grandchildren. They live in Marietta and attend Mount Zion United Methodist Church, where Isakson previously taught sixth grade Sunday school for 30 years."
22209,248294,"FL","S","HI","S02","","Mazie","Hirono","K.","Sen.","","US Senator","Narrative Bio","",2017-05-11 00:00:00,"I am privileged to serve the people of Hawaii in the United States Senate. As an immigrant who grew up under difficult circumstances, I recognize that my path to the Senate was unlikely. At the same time, my experiences have shown me the incredible opportunities available in America and have fueled my desire to give back.Of course, I owe much to the courage and determination of my mother. My early childhood was spent on my grandparents' rice farm in Fukushima, Japan. My mother sent me to live with my grandparents because of family circumstances. My father was an alcoholic and compulsive gambler and I did not get to know him much. As a result, our family had little stability or money. At times, he would even sell my mother's belongings to gamble away.But instead of watching our family continue to suffer, my mother made the courageous decision to seek a better life for us. She plotted and planned in secret, and when I was nearly eight years old, we literally escaped to this place called Hawaii and this country called America. My mother, brother and I boarded the President Cleveland in Yokohama and set sail across the Pacific in steerage.Like many immigrants, our new life was not easy. In the beginning, my mother worked at a Japanese language newspaper for minimum wages with no benefits. She worked two jobs as a single mother to keep food on the table and a roof over our heads. We didn't have much, but we persevered.Thanks to my mother's courage, I was able to take advantage of the educational opportunities available in Hawaii's public schools. When I began elementary school, I neither spoke nor read English. My love of reading was awakened by class trips to our school library where our librarian read to us books like Mary Poppins. I also remember being a student cashier in elementary school to pay for my lunches. At that time, I dreamt of being a teacher or a counselor so I could one day help others.My time at the University of Hawaii at Manoa opened my eyes to a life in public service and advocacy. Through volunteer and tutor work, as well as weekly visits with patients at the state mental health facility, I saw how important it was for underserved populations to be heard. Participating in grassroots student protests over the Vietnam War ignited my sense of possibility over what ordinary people joining together could accomplish.I felt that studying law would help me develop the skills I would need to more effectively advocate for others. I attended Georgetown University Law Center because it had a strong clinical program and I wanted to focus on public interest law. After graduation, I worked in the antitrust division of the Hawaii attorney general's office.Although prior to law school I had helped many others run for office, I had not thought much about becoming a candidate myself. However, with the encouragement of others, I successfully ran for a seat in the Hawaii House of Representatives in 1980. As chair of the House Consumer Protection and Commerce Committee, I focused on greater protections for Hawaii's workers and consumers.After serving more than a decade in the House, I was elected lieutenant governor in 1994. I led an effort to revamp Hawaii's workers' compensation insurance laws, saving businesses millions. I also helped lead state efforts to improve early childhood education and promote Hawaii's tourism industry through visa reform, issues I continue to champion in the U.S. Senate.As my party's first female nominee for governor, although I lost the race in 2002, I wanted to keep other women running for office and founded the Patsy T. Mink PAC in 2004 to that end. Congresswoman Patsy Mink, for whom Title IX was renamed after her death, was my friend and continuing inspiration.In 2006, I was elected to Congress by voters in Hawaii's second congressional district, representing the seat once held by Patsy. During my time in the House, our nation and state faced incredible challenges and opportunities. I supported struggling families by preserving Hawaii's pre-paid health care law, teamed up with colleagues across the aisle to protect Native Hawaiian education programs, promoted food and energy sustainability and sponsored legislation to support Hawaii's critical tourism industry and create jobs.With the retirement of Senator Daniel Akaka, the people of Hawaii elected me to the U.S. Senate, where I serve as the first and only Asian American woman and first woman senator from Hawaii. It was a privilege to have worked with Senators Inouye and Akaka over the years, and I am working to deliver results for Hawaii by building on the strong foundations they laid. I serve on the Committee on Armed Services, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Select Committee on Intelligence, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and am the Ranking Member of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power. All of these committees deal with issues important to Hawaii's people.It is a privilege to do my very best for Hawaii in the U.S. Senate. With my background and experiences, I never forget where I came from or who I fight for and why."

Senator Grassley also has conducted at least one meeting in each of Iowa's 99 counties every year that he's served in the United States Senate, to encourage participation in the process of representative government.  Grassley stays connected by responding to every phone call, letter and email from Iowans, and by communicating with Iowans extensively online via Facebook, Twitter and his own website, as well.In Washington, Senator Grassley has been a leader in shaping legislation to improve the quality of life for Americans and to expand the economic opportunities for individuals, families and communities.Grassley serves as Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, where he works for a competitive marketplace with antitrust enforcement and tort reform, to reward innovation and invention with an updated patent system, and for legal immigration that will help America's economy grow.  Grassley has led a campaign to open up the federal judiciary by allowing cameras in courtrooms, and he is unmatched in his legislative and oversight work to protect whistleblowers, both in and out of government, who speak up about wrongdoing for the public good.  Grassley is an advocate for victims of crime and a leader in the fight to keep illegal drugs out of the hands of young people.  He leads efforts to safeguard America's freedom with effective anti-terrorism and domestic security policies.Previously, as Chairman of the Committee on Finance, Senator Grassley led through Congress $2 trillion in tax cuts, leaving more money in workers' pockets, making the tax code more progressive, and spurring economic growth and activity.  Grassley is an outspoken advocate for free trade agreements that expand opportunities for job-creating U.S. exports in manufacturing and agriculture.  He's a leader in the development of wind, solar, biodiesel, biomass and ethanol as domestic, renewable energy sources to help fuel America's future.  Senator Grassley authored the Senate bill that created the Medicare prescription drug benefit, bringing the program up-to-date with the practice of medicine and better enabling treatment outside of expensive hospital stays.  He's a leading advocate to improve the foster care system and help more kids find permanent, loving homes through adoption.Grassley also serves as a senior member of the Senate Committee on the Budget, where he applies his personal frugality to the public purse, and on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, where he brings real-life experience as a family farmer to farm policy.Along with legislation, Senator Grassley commits tremendous time and energy to congressional oversight.  He works to shed light on the federal bureaucracy.  He champions transparency when it comes to the people's business.  Whistleblower laws authored by Senator Grassley are the federal government's no. 1 anti-fraud tool.  Thanks to Grassley's ongoing legislative victories to protect whistleblowers, taxpayers have gotten back more than $28 billion that would otherwise have been lost to fraud.  Grassley's congressional oversight holds accountable those who do business on the taxpayers' tab.He's leading efforts to make sure the Securities and Exchange Commission protects investors and America's financial system.  He weeds out fraudulent schemes that bilk billions of dollars from the Medicare program and rides herd on Medicare and Medicaid officials to ensure quality care in nursing homes and program accountability for both taxpayers and beneficiaries.

Following her recovery, she became Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs, working to create a tax credit for employers who hired Veterans, establish a first-in-the-nation 24/7 Veterans crisis hotline and develop innovative programs to improve Veterans' access to housing and health care.In 2009, President Obama appointed Duckworth to be Assistant Secretary of Veterans Affairs. At VA, Duckworth coordinated the joint initiative with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to end Veteran homelessness. She also created the Office of Online Communications to improve the VA's accessibility, especially among young Veterans, and also worked to address the unique challenges that Native American and female Veterans face.Since her recovery, Duckworth has resumed flying as a civilian pilot and fulfilled a promise she made at Walter Reed by completing several marathons. In her spare time, she volunteers at local food pantries and enjoys couponing and flea markets. In 2015, Duckworth completed her Ph.D in Human Services at Capella University.In the U.S. House, Duckworth was an advocate for working families and job creation, introducing bills like her bipartisan Friendly Airports for Mothers Act to ensure new mothers have access to safe, clean and accessible lactation rooms when traveling through airports, which passed the Senate. She introduced the In the Red Act to help put our nation on the path toward debt-free college, the Get the Lead Out Act to keep America's drinking water safe and bipartisan legislation to help close the skills gap while helping people find good-paying jobs. Duckworth also co-sponsored the No Budget, No Pay Act, which would ensure members of Congress only get paid if they pass a budget.She also served on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, where she was Ranking Member of the Transportation and Public Assets subcommittee. She introduced and helped pass several important policies through her work on these committees, including the Clay Hunt SAV Act to help reduce Veterans suicide and improve VA mental health services and the Troop Talent Act which helps returning Veterans find jobs in the private sector. She also effectively cut waste and fraud at the Pentagon and throughout government, including passing a common-sense provision to reduce redundancy in Armed Forces uniforms that the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found will save taxpayers more than $4 billion over 5 years.In the U.S. Senate, Duckworth serves on several influential committees that give her an important platform to advocate for Illinois's working families and entrepreneurs- the Environment & Public Works Committee; the Energy & Natural Resources Committee; the Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee; and the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Committee. As Senator, she advocates for practical, common-sense solutions needed to move our country and our state forward like- rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, keeping our water systems safe and lead-free, growing manufacturing jobs while supporting minority-owned small businesses, investing in communities that have been ignored for too long, and making college more affordable for all Americans. And Duckworth continues with her lifelong mission of supporting, protecting and keeping the promises we've made to our Veterans as well as ensuring that we stand fully behind the troops we send into danger overseas.Senator Duckworth lives in Hoffman Estates with her husband Bryan, an Army Cyber Warrant Officer, and their daughter Abigail."

As the chairman of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, he prioritizes investments at the Department of Defense in infrastructure at home and abroad, the quality of life for military families, and also improving the Department of Veterans Affairs to better serve our nation's veterans. This new chairmanship for the 115th Congress rounds out Sen. Moran's focus on national security and complements his membership on the Defense and State, Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittees.As a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Senator Moran advocates on behalf of Kansans regarding a number of issues vital to the state's economy ranging from communications and product safety to highways, aviation and railways. As chairman of the Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance and Data Security Commerce Subcommittee, Sen. Moran continues his strong advocacy for data security and consumer protections.Senator Moran understands that overregulation is the among greatest threat to the economy of rural America, and his roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies position him well to advocate for family farmers and ranchers and work to eliminate burdensome regulations that threaten the future of rural America. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works maintains jurisdiction over a wide variety of federal policies concerning environment, energy, wildlife, and infrastructure issues, which directly impact the day-to-day functions of our farmers, small businesses, and families in Kansas. Senator Moran also continues his work to improve the quality of life for the nearly 250,000 veterans living in Kansas as a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. He continues fighting to make certain our nation's heroes receive the quality healthcare and benefits they have earned in a timely fashion.Since joining the U.S. Senate, Senator Moran has also been a leading advocate for issues related to entrepreneurship, job creation and innovation. He is committed to putting policies in place that foster a pro-growth environment where businesses can succeed without government imposed barriers.Senator Moran serves as a member of a number of caucuses that enhance his ability to represent Kansans' interests in the United States Senate. His focus on protecting rural Kansans and their communities led him to co-found the Senate Community Pharmacy Caucus, Senate Economic Mobility Caucus and Senate Hunger Caucus. He also serves as co-chair of the Congressional Task Force on Down Syndrome, the Senate Aerospace Caucus and the Senate Defense Community Caucus.For the 2014 election cycle, Senator Moran served as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC). Under Senator Moran's leadership, Republicans gained a net increase of nine seats - the largest Senate swing by any party since 1980 and the largest Senate gain in a midterm election since 1958, resulting in a Republican Senate Majority.Prior to his election to the Senate in November 2010, Moran served Kansans in the ""Big First"" Congressional district for seven terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, as well as eight years in the Kansas State Senate - spending the last two years as Majority Leader.

For 16 years, he represented the Big First District, including his home of Dodge City, in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1996, he was elected to the U.S. Senate. He is currently serving his fourth term.Senator Roberts is Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. He was the first member of Congress in history to have chaired both the House Agriculture Committee and now the Senate committee. He has also served as the ranking member of each committee. Senator Roberts continues his work in the 115th Congress, his second term as Chairman, ensuring that farmers and ranchers have the tools they need to advance American agriculture. He is fighting barriers to trade and regulations that threaten producers' competitiveness.As a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, Roberts gives Kansans increased leadership on legislation ranging from taxes to trade, health care, Medicare, Social Security, the aviation industry and transportation - issues impacting all Kansas families.Roberts' record shows his long-standing concern for Kansas communities, businesses and families. A member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, Roberts has passed legislation to address the high cost of quality childcare and has long supported fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA). As co-chairman of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, Roberts has worked hard to ensure rural communities have access to the same affordable high quality care as their urban counterparts. He has fought to improve Medicare for patients and providers including rural hospitals, doctors and pharmacists. He voted against Obamacare and will work to repeal it and replace it with a plan that would lower health care costs for all families, and prohibit cost controls that would interfere with treatment decisions between doctors and patients.Roberts is committed to increasing Kansas' investment in math, science and technology, urging schools and universities to remain highly competitive by investing in research infrastructure. He also helped pass the first education-reform legislation since 2001 - including his legislation to stop the federal government from forcing Common Core on states.Roberts recognized the biosciences industry developing in Kansas starting in 1996 and has carefully looked for ways to enhance its development to promote an industry that has tremendous potential for growth, will keep Kansas' best and brightest in Kansas and will make Americans safer. Roberts has been recognized as a leader in food and biosecurity. He held the first hearings on the issue in Congress, has helped pass major biosecurity legislation, assisted Kansas State and other Kansas schools in gaining federal research investments, leading to the Biosecurity Research Institute (BRI) at Kansas State (housed in Pat Roberts Hall).

He is the most senior Marine in the Congress and established the Senate Marine Corps Caucus in 2015.As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee for four years, Roberts worked to improve intelligence gathering and analysis capabilities at a critical time in our nation's history. When concerns arose regarding the timing and accuracy of U.S. intelligence on pre-war Iraq, Roberts led the Intelligence Committee through one of the most sweeping and exhaustive reviews of U.S. intelligence ever conducted. The bipartisan report, unanimously approved by the members of the Intelligence Committee, revealed systemic failures within the intelligence community. The review led Roberts to propose critical and forward thinking intelligence reforms. Many of his proposals were included in the 9/11 Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. In 2004, Roberts delivered the prestigious Landon Lecture at Kansas State University on national security topics.Roberts is also proud to serve as Chairman of the Eisenhower Memorial Commission, working to complete a National Memorial to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower and inspire future generations with his devotion to public service, leadership, integrity, life-long work ethic, and his total devotion to the values and processes of democracy.Senator Roberts is also privileged to be a member of the Senate Rules Committee and the Senate Ethics Committee.Pat Roberts is a fourth generation Kansan.

President Obama asked her to set up the new agency to hold Wall Street banks and other financial institutions accountable, and to protect consumers from financial tricks and traps often hidden in mortgages, credit cards and other financial products.In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Warren served as Chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Her independent and tireless efforts to protect taxpayers, to hold Wall Street accountable, and to ensure tough oversight of both the Bush and Obama Administrations won praise from both sides of the aisle. The Boston Globe named Elizabeth Warren Bostonian of the Year and TIME Magazine called her a ""New Sheriff of Wall Street"" for her oversight efforts.During her campaign for the Senate, Elizabeth promised to fight for middle class families and to make sure that everyone has a fair shot to get ahead. She called for policies that would level the regulatory playing field for small businesses and ensure that everyone - even large and powerful corporations - pays a fair share in taxes and is held accountable for breaking the law.Endorsing Elizabeth's candidacy, the New Bedford Standard-Times  said, ""Elizabeth Warren has it right on all the things that matter most to us in SouthCoast and across Massachusetts"" with ""principles that without a doubt, promote the well-being of the middle class.""

New companies entered the market with digital technology, forcing the incumbents to innovate and invest and pushing mobile phone prices down.Congressman Markey authored the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996, ushering competition into the telecommunications marketplace and unleashing private sector investment.  Competition remains Senator Markey's economic mantra.  He has been instrumental in breaking up anti-consumer, anti-innovative monopolies in electricity, long-distance and local telephone service, cable television, and international satellite services. He was one of the only members of the House Commerce Committee to fight AT&T's monopoly in the early 1980's and is a principal author of the requirement that the Bell Operating companies accept local telephone service in the 1990's. His pro-competition policies have directly benefited job creation in Massachusetts and throughout the country. While in the House, Congressman Markey introduced the Internet Freedom Preservation Act, the first net neutrality bill introduced in Congress, to ensure that as the Internet continues to evolve, it remains a level playing field guided by the principles of openness, competition and innovation.

Since then, Senator Markey has continued his work on nuclear nonproliferation, successfully enacting new restrictions on exports of nuclear and dual-use technologies to Iran, North Korea, and other countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism and pressing for stronger nuclear nonproliferation conditions on all future nuclear trade cooperation agreements As founder of the Nonproliferation Caucus, Senator Markey continues to spearhead efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to safeguard the future for generations to come.He is the author of some of the most important Wall Street reform laws since the Great Depression, including statutes that strengthened penalties against insider trading, improved federal oversight over the stock and futures markets, and reformed regulation of the government securities market.  Senator Markey was born in Malden, Massachusetts, on July 11, 1946. He attended Boston College (B.A., 1968) and Boston College Law School (J.D., 1972).

In 2002, he was elected to represent Maryland's 8th Congressional District.

He is a proven consensus-builder who ""calls 'em like he sees 'em"" putting civility and respect ahead of political ideology.Senator King is a member of the Armed Services Committee, the Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the Committee on the Budget, and the Committee on Rules and Administration. He has made it a priority not to miss Committee hearings, earning him praise from his colleagues and the reputation as a workhorse in the Senate. Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) once called Senator King ""one of the most serious and hard-working members"" of the Committee.In his time in the Senate, Senator King has worked to strengthen America's national security, conducted critical oversight of the nation's Intelligence Community, supported common-sense budget priorities that promote prosperity and reduce the national debt, fought the national opioid and heroin epidemic, coordinated efforts to revitalize Maine's forest economy, advocated for policies that contribute to cleaner, cheaper energy and mitigate climate change, railed against the corrosive effect of unchecked money in politics, fought to improve access to health care, worked to strengthen the government's support of veterans, and promoted increased access to critical community resources like rural broadband.Senator King has already achieved significant legislative victories. In 2013, when students across America faced the financial threat of a significant increase in their student loan interest rates, Senator King spearheaded the effort to draft and pass through both the Senate and House the compromise legislation that not only averted rate hikes, but that also put the program on long-term stable financial footing. That hard-fought bipartisan solution, the Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013, has since been projected to save millions of students across the country more than $50 billion in interest payments.During the government shutdown of 2014, Senator King worked tirelessly with a small group of moderate senators, led by his colleague and friend Senator Susan Collins, to formulate the action plan that eventually led to the reopening of the government.In fact, it is in small working groups like this that Senator King has focused much of his work. He co-founded the Former Governors Caucus, which brings together the Senate's former Governors to chart pragmatic approaches to solutions, as well as the Senate Arctic Caucus, which hones in on Maine and America's growing interest in the Arctic. Senator King also tries to informally bridge the partisan divide in Washington by frequently bringing his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to his home for barbeque dinners, where political talk is banned and the focus is getting to know one another. The bonds that are formed through these relationships often lay the foundation for successful legislation.Senator King also served as the 72nd Governor of Maine, and during his two terms in the Blaine House, he focused on economic development and job creation.  Then-Governor King also achieved significant reforms in education, mental health services, land conservation, environmental protection, and the delivery of state services. He was re-elected in 1998 by one of the largest margins in Maine's history.Senator King is married to Mary Herman and has four sons, Angus III, Duncan, James, and Ben, one daughter, Molly, and six grandchildren. He was born in Virginia and attended Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia Law School. In his free time, he enjoys exploring the Maine outdoors - either on his Harley or with his family in their camper."

She took the oath of office on January 3, 2013.Senator Heitkamp grew up in a large family in the small town of Mantador, North Dakota. Alongside her six brothers and sisters, she learned the value of hard work and responsibility, leading her to choose a life of public service.Already in her short time in the U.S. Senate, Senator Heitkamp has quickly become a proven senator who works across the aisle to fight for North Dakotans. Senator Heitkamp has personally shown that if senators work together, it can lead to real solutions.As a former director of the one-of-a-kind Dakota Gasification synfuels plant, Senator Heitkamp has a long record of serving as a champion for North Dakota's energy jobs and industry. She is continuing those efforts in the Senate, working to responsibly harness North Dakota's energy resources, promoting the state's all-of-the-above energy plan which she believes should serve as a model for the entire country, and fighting to lift the 40-year old ban on exporting U.S. crude oil.Senator Heitkamp sits on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, where she has been fighting for North Dakota's farmers and ranchers to make sure they get the resources and support they need to continue to feed North Dakota, the country, and the world. Starting on day one in the Senate, she helped write, negotiate, and pass a long-term, comprehensive Farm Bill which Congress passed in 2014.As a member on the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Heitkamp is continuing her pledge -- from her time as North Dakota's Attorney General -- to stand up for Native American families and make sure the U.S. government lives up to its treaty and trust responsibilities. The first bill she introduced in the Senate would better protect Native children and make sure they have the economic and educational tools to thrive.Through her leadership on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Senator Heitkamp has pushed to reform the nation's housing finance system, make housing more affordable, address North Dakota's housing shortage, and provide relief to small financial institutions.On the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Senator Heitkamp serves as the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management. Through her work on the Committee, Senator Heitkamp has pushed to provide training and resources for first responders, improve mail delivery and service in rural communities, help recruit and retain a strong federal workforce, and cut red tape to make the federal government more efficient and effective for North Dakota families and small businesses.Senator Heitkamp also serves on the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship where she has worked to support the small businesses and startups throughout North Dakota and rural communities. She introduced a bill to address challenges facing startups in North Dakota, as well as other rural states and small cities, by helping them get the early stage funding they need to grow their businesses.Senator Heitkamp previously served as North Dakota's Attorney General, battling drug dealers, protecting senior citizens from scams, and working to keep sexual predators off streets and away from kids, even after their prison terms were up. During her time as North Dakota's Attorney General, Senator Heitkamp brokered an agreement between 46 states and the tobacco industry, which forced the tobacco industry to tell the truth about smoking and health. The settlement resulted in the award of about $336 million to North Dakota taxpayers to date. It was one of the largest civil settlements in U.S. history. When very little of this funding was being spent on anti-tobacco programs as intended, Senator Heitkamp led a successful ballot initiative in 2008 that mandated significant increases.Previously, Senator Heitkamp served as North Dakota's Tax Commissioner. Under her tenure, the State of North Dakota attempted to make catalog retailers collect the sales tax the state and municipalities were already owed on sales. The debate went all the way to the Supreme Court in the case Quill v. North Dakota.Senator Heitkamp received a B.A. from the University of North Dakota and a law degree from Lewis and Clark Law School. She lives in Mandan, North Dakota with her husband, Dr. Darwin Lange, a family practitioner. They have two children, Ali and Nathan."

He is committed to creating a business climate that fosters job growth and robust economic activity. Equally important to the senator are measures to reduce the nation's budget deficits and debt.  He believes a commonsense approach that fosters free enterprise and empowers people to innovate and invest will strengthen our national economy and create jobs for our country in a sustainable, ongoing way.As a senator, Hoeven has been leading efforts to develop a comprehensive national energy plan similar to North Dakota's EmPower North Dakota, a comprehensive plan that encourages an all-of-the-above approach to development and includes both traditional and renewable resources. Hoeven believes such an approach will lead to jobs, economic growth and true energy security for America.  The senator's work includes serving as the leading advocate for approving the Keystone XL pipeline and advancing measures that will eliminate outdated and unnecessary regulations that are prolonging the approval process and discouraging investment and innovation. In addition, as a member of both the Agriculture Committee and the conference committee that negotiated the 2014 final farm bill, Hoeven played a crucial role in crafting and passing a long term farm bill that provides the nation's producers with the certainty they need to plan for the future, as well as new tools to manage risk with enhanced crop insurance. The senator continues to work to make sure the farm bill is implemented in a timely and effective way.Prior to his election to the Senate, Senator Hoeven served as governor of North Dakota for a decade.  Under his leadership, the state expanded and diversified its economy and gained thousands of new jobs.  North Dakota's wages and personal income today continue to grow faster than the national average, and in recent years the state has led the nation in export growth.  North Dakota regularly balances its budget, has set aside more strong reserves for the future, cut taxes, and invested in priorities like education, law enforcement and infrastructure.As governor, Hoeven also placed a strong focus on developing North Dakota's vast energy resources.  Beginning in 2002, he initiated EmPower ND, a comprehensive energy plan for the state that includes all energy resources as well as a conservation component.  Today, North Dakota stands as an energy powerhouse and one of the largest energy producing and exporting states in the nation. Currently, North Dakota produces more than one million barrels of oil a day and ranks as the second largest oil-producing state in the country.Senator Hoeven was born in Bismarck.  He earned a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College in 1979 and a master's degree in business administration from Northwestern University in 1981.  He served as executive vice president of First Western Bank in Minot from 1986 to 1993, and served on many civic, community, and economic development groups.  From 1993-2000, he served as president and CEO of the Bank of North Dakota, which grew from $900 million to $1.6 billion under his leadership.Hoeven and his wife Mical (Mikey) live in Bismarck.

22261,165265,"FL","S","OR","S01","","Ron","Wyden","","Sen.","","US Senator","Narrative Bio","",2018-01-26 00:00:00,"Whether he's taking on powerful interests, listening to constituents at one of his famous town hall meetings or standing up for Oregonians on the floor of the U.S. Senate, Ron Wyden is an effective leader on the issues that matter most.  As the Wall Street Journal's Kimberly Strassel recently put it- ""He's best described as a wonk, a workhorse, a doer."" Oregonians know Ron as a senator who listens.  Always citing the need to ""throw open the doors of government for Oregonians"" he holds an open-to-all town hall meeting in each of Oregon's 36 counties each year.  Thus far he has held more than 700 meetings.  Wyden's dedication to hearing all sides of an issue and looking for common sense, non-partisan solutions has won him trust on both sides of the aisle and put him at the heart of nearly every debate.   In 2011, the Almanac of American Politics described Wyden as having ""displayed a genius for coming up with sensible-sounding ideas no one else had thought of and making the counter-intuitive political alliances that prove helpful in passing bills.""  The Washington Post's Ezra Klein wrote- ""The country has problems.  And Ron Wyden has comprehensive, bipartisan proposals for fixing them.""Wyden believes the nation's biggest challenges can only be solved by what he calls ""principled bipartisanship"" solutions that allow all parties to stay true to their respective principles and celebrate agreements.  Following that approach has helped him author more than 150 bipartisan bills and assemble unprecedented bipartisan coalitions on issues such as health care, infrastructure and tax reform.When principles are at stake, however, Wyden has never shied from standing alone, even when it means taking on powerful interest groups or his own party.  His lone stand against the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) and its predecessor, the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeit Act (COICA), put a spotlight on the problematic legislation being fast tracked through Congress and served as a rallying point for the historic Internet protests that ultimately toppled the bills.  He stood alone on the floor of the Senate to block right wing efforts to overturn Oregon's Death with Dignity law; a law that Oregon voters have passed twice. He went head-to-head with the E.P.A. to reduce cancer-causing benzene in gasoline sold in Oregon, and key elements of Wyden's Kinship Care Act were included as part of major reforms improving the nation's foster care system. Wyden's provisions recognized and strengthened support for kinship care, the full-time care and protection of children by relatives.His relentless defiance of the national security community's abuse of secrecy forced the declassification of the CIA Inspector General's 9/11 report, shut down the controversial Total Information Awareness program and put a spotlight on both the Bush and Obama Administration's reliance on ""secret law.""  To protect hard-working folks in the intelligence community and ensure informed public debate on national security issues, Wyden successfully fought to have controversial anti-leaks provisions removed from the latest intelligence authorization bill.Wyden has taken the lead on policies that are helping to grow the economy in areas like improved infrastructure through his Build America Bonds program, micro and nano-technology, e-commerce, and through incentives for cleaner sources of energy.He has won countless awards for his pioneering role in establishing a free and open Internet, is known for his commitment to an open government, having authored the ""Stand By Your Ad"" law and the resolution ending Senate Secret Holds, and he has been routinely recognized as one of the Senate's foremost health policy thinkers.  In Oregon, Wyden has authored laws extending permanent Wilderness protections to more than 400,000 acres including Mt. Hood, the Columbia River Gorge, Oregon's Bull Run Watershed, Badlands, Spring Basin, Copper Salmon and Soda Mountain.  Since 2000, the Wyden-authored Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act, commonly known as the ""county payments"" law, has helped provide a stable source of revenue for historically timber-dependent communities and Wyden's Combat Illegal Logging Act has helped protect Oregon's hardwood industries from the import of illegally harvested timber products.Wyden serves on the Committees on Finance, Budget, Intelligence, and Energy and Natural Resources.  He is ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee and the ranking Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.Wyden began college at the University of California-Santa Barbara where he won a basketball scholarship and played in Division I competition for two seasons before transferring to Stanford University where he completed his Bachelors degree with distinction.  He earned his law degree from the University of Oregon School of Law in 1974, after which he taught gerontology and co-founded the Oregon chapter of the Gray Panthers, an advocacy group for the elderly.  He also served as the director of Oregon Legal Services for the Elderly from 1977 to 1979 and was a member of the Oregon State Board of Examiners of Nursing Home Administrators during that same period. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1981 until his election to the U.S. Senate.Senator Wyden's home is in Portland; he is married to Nancy Wyden, whom he wed in September 2005. He has five children- Adam, Lilly, Ava, William and Scarlett."

The son of a millwright, he grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood where - as Jeff says - his mother ""stretched a dollar as far as anyone possibly could."" Today, he still lives in that neighborhood and his kids have gone to the same public schools he attended.  Jeff has lived the American dream and has focused his whole career - both in elected office and running non-profits - on making sure that all Oregonians have the same opportunity to make a better life for themselves and their families.Jeff's policy studies began at the dinner table. Each night his father read the newspaper, turned on the evening news, and discussed ways to improve our communities and our nation. The first in his family to attend college, Jeff studied international relations and, at age 19, began his career in public service as an intern for former Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield - never imagining that he would one day return to hold Senator Hatfield's seat.Because Jeff saw first-hand at home and in his neighborhood that a good-paying job is more effective than any government program, Jeff's top priority in the Senate has been creating jobs and laying the foundation for economic growth that benefits working families, not just the stock market.  He successfully led passage of the Water Infrastructure Financing Innovation Act to help local communities replace aging sewer and drinking water systems and save ratepayers money.  He expanded Buy America programs so that taxpayer dollars are spent on American steel and other materials whenever possible, and wrote legislation to crack down on unfair and illegal trade practices that threaten Oregon jobs.Jeff has been a leader in bringing accountability and oversight back to Wall Street. He authored one of the toughest amendments in the Wall Street reform bill to separate hedge-fund-like gambling from traditional banking that businesses and families rely on. And he's fought to keep families in their homes and end the predatory practices of the subprime mortgage crisis by writing the law that ended egregious mortgage lending practices and banned hidden steering payments, liar loans and prepayment penalties.Jeff knows firsthand how important a strong public education system is to building strong families as well as a successful economy. He's worked to increase investment in Head Start and K-12 education, including sponsoring legislation to boost career and technical education and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) teaching in public schools. He's been a fierce advocate to lower student loan rates and make college more affordable for middle class families, cosponsoring a bill to allow refinancing of student loans  and introducing innovative legislation based on Oregon's ""Pay It Forward"" concept that would allow more students to attend college debt-free.Jeff believes that a secure retirement is a key pillar of the American dream, and has pushed back against both Democrats and Republicans to ensure we don't weaken Social Security and Medicare or cut the benefits that seniors have earned with a lifetime of hard work. He introduced the Fair Raises for Seniors Act to ensure that Social Security cost-of-living adjustments more accurately keep up with the expenses seniors face, and has been an outspoken supporter of the Medicare Protection Act to prevent efforts to weaken, privatize, or ""voucher-ize"" Medicare.To make the Senate more effective in taking on special interests and working for the middle class, Jeff challenged his own leadership to support a historic reform of the chamber's rules to prevent gridlock and promote debate.  Thanks to Jeff's push, the Senate was finally able to put a cop on the beat to stop big banks from taking advantage of their customers and prevent the oil and gas industries from decapitating the agency charged with keeping our air and water clean.  Jeff is nationally recognized as a reformer working to break Congressional gridlock and reform the Senate so it will be more responsive to the needs of ordinary middle class families.Jeff's work in the Senate is a continuation of a lifetime of working to make Oregon and the world a better place.  During his term as Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives, Jeff led a legislative session The Oregonian deemed one of ""Oregon's most productive in a generation."" Under Jeff's leadership, the state legislature increased education funding, expanded access to affordable prescription drugs, established domestic partnerships and a landmark civil rights law to protect LGBT Oregonians from discrimination, cracked down on predatory lending, and created Oregon's first-ever rainy day fund.  Prior to running for office, Jeff ran several non-profits in Portland, including Portland Habitat for Humanity, which empowers low-income families through homeownership.Jeff is a member of the Appropriations Committee; the Environment and Public Works Committee; the Budget Committee; and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He and his wife Mary Sorteberg, a nurse, have been married for more than twenty years and have two children, Brynne and Jonathan, and an Airedale terrier, Sadie."

He was the prime Senate sponsor of landmark legislation for individuals with disabilities, the Stephen Beck Jr. Achieving a Better Life Experience Act (ABLE). ABLE will allow millions of families across the United States to save for the long term care of their loved ones with a disability in a tax-advantage savings account. The Associated Press hailed this legislation as ""the most important new law for [those with disabilities] in 25 years."" Senator Casey believes that people with disabilities have a lot of ability and we must give those with disabilities the tools to succeed in the workforce and to live a full life.As concerns arose across the nation about the dangers of campus sexual assault, Senator Casey took action and passed into law the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act. The Campus SaVE Act requires uniform reporting standards for sexual assaults on college campuses and requires schools to provide clear guidelines to students on their sexual assault policies. The new law also emphasizes steps schools can take to educate students and help prevent sexual assault.In eight years as Pennsylvania Auditor General and two years as State Treasurer, Bob Casey compiled a record that focused on making government more accountable and responsive to the needs of Pennsylvanians. He has been a fiscal watchdog who made nursing homes safer, child care more affordable and government more accountable. He led the fight to reform Megan's Law to better protect Pennsylvania children and communities.Senator Casey serves on four Senate committees- Finance; Health, Education, Labor and Pensions; Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; and the Special Committee on Aging. Born and raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Bob Casey graduated from The College of the Holy Cross in 1982 and spent the following year teaching fifth grade and coaching eighth grade basketball in inner city Philadelphia for the Jesuit Volunteer Corps.

He was nominated for an appointment to the United States Military Academy by U.S. Senator John O. Pastore.  On July 3, 1967, Reed reported to West Point to begin cadet training.  After graduating from the Military Academy in 1971 Reed earned a master's degree in public policy from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.  Reed also went on to earn a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1982.One of the highest honors and greatest privileges of Jack's life was commanding his fellow soldiers.  He served in the 82nd Airborne Division as an Infantry Platoon Leader, a Company Commander, and a Battalion Staff Officer.  He eventually joined the faculty at West Point, teaching cadets about economics and international relations as an Associate Professor within the Department of Social Sciences.  He served as a professor at the U.S. Military Academy until August of 1979 when he resigned from active duty as a Captain.  After graduating from law school, Jack became an attorney in private practice, first working as an associate with the law firm of Sutherland, Asbill, & Brennan before moving back to Providence and working for the firm of Edwards & Angell.  He specialized in banking and securities law.Reed served three terms in the Rhode Island State Senate, where he focused on housing, children's welfare, and mental health issues.  The people of Rhode Island then elected him to serve three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.  In 1996, the people of Rhode Island elected Jack Reed to succeed Claiborne Pell as Rhode Island's 46th United States Senator.A member of the powerful Appropriations Committee Senator Reed has been described by the Boston Globe as ""a relentless advocate for his home state.""  As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development, he works tirelessly to direct federal funding to the Ocean State to create jobs, strengthen its infrastructure, and support economic and community development initiatives. He has supported clean water projects to ensure both a healthy economy and a healthy environment.  And he authored a trio of laws to improve children's health care and ensure our youngest patients get the help they need when they need it- the Conquer Childhood Cancer Act, a law that expands research programs aimed at improving childhood cancer treatments with the goal of ultimately finding a cure for childhood cancer; the Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act to establish critical care networks nationwide so that more paramedics and first responders can get trauma care patients to the right doctor at the right time; and the Better Pharmaceuticals and Devices for Children Act (BPDCA) to help ensure drugs and medical devices are specifically tested, labeled, and proven to be safe and effective for children.Reed also serves as Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee, where he has played a pivotal role in safeguarding our nation.  In 2002, he voted against giving President George W. Bush the authority to go to war in Iraq because it was an ill-planned diversion from the war on terrorism.  But he has always worked across the aisle to support our troops, and was instrumental in convincing Defense Secretary Robert Gates to continue serving in the Obama Administration and implement the plan to withdraw forces from Iraq.Rhode Island's defense industry is critical to national security and our state's economy, and Senator Reed has been a leader at the federal level in growing Rhode Island's defense sector and bringing resources to the state.  Thanks to his efforts on the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees, coupled with Rhode Island's talented defense workers, the U.S. Navy plans to begin building the next generation of submarines in the Ocean State, creating thousands of new, good-paying jobs in Rhode Island in the coming years. As a senior member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, Reed authored several key pieces of the historic Wall Street reform bill and has been nationally recognized for his dedication to protecting U.S. consumers.  When taxpayers were forced to invest in banks to save the economy from total collapse, Jack Reed wrote the law ensuring that taxpayers would share in the rewards when the banks recovered.  As a direct result of Reed's provision, taxpayers have earned more than $9.4 billion in additional dividends - money that would have otherwise been kept by the rescued banks.He also helped create the powerful new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to give American families the tools to fight unfair and abusive financial products and services, as well as a new Office of Financial Research (OFR) that will help provide early warnings to regulators about future financial problems.Recently, he authored laws to create a new affordable rental housing trust fund, improve consumer disclosures on mortgages, and address the needs of middle-class families who are struggling with the fallout from the housing crisis.Senator Reed has been a leading voice on college affordability and student loan debt issues.  He helped write laws preventing interest rate increases on new loans to millions of college students, and fought efforts to increase student borrowing costs.  He recently proposed a Student Loan Borrowers Bill of Rights and has offered legislation to reform disclosure and servicing standards for both federal and private student loans.And to help get our country back to full employment, he wrote a work-sharing law that provides an estimated $500 million for business-state partnerships to help prevent layoffs. Nationwide, Jack Reed's law has helped save more than 92,000 jobs since 2012, including about 1,000 in Rhode Island. Jack Reed and his wife, Julia Hart Reed, have a daughter, Emily."

Sheldon believes that every child deserves the opportunities provided by a good education, and that anyone willing to work hard should be able to find a good job. He believes in the promise of Social Security and Medicare to provide a basic measure of dignity for seniors when they retire.Sheldon has hosted more than 100 community dinners in every corner of the state to hear the concerns of Rhode Islanders. He is dedicated to helping small businesses grow, making health care affordable for every family, and fighting to break through the barricade of special interests in Washington that are blocking action on climate change. The Providence Journal described Sheldon as ""a strong-willed and articulate member of the Senate on national issues and an energetic champion of Rhode Island economic and other interests.""The examples set by people like his father, a World War II Veteran and diplomat, and by great figures in Rhode Island public life, like U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell and Governor Bruce Sundlun, taught Sheldon the good that public service can do for our country and our state. Throughout his more than thirty years in public service, Sheldon has focused on the basic issues that make a real difference in people's lives.Sheldon understands that in tough economic times it's harder for families to make ends meet. That's why creating good jobs and strengthening our small businesses are his top priorities.To get more Americans back to work, Sheldon has introduced legislation to give tax credits to companies that hire unemployed workers, and to eliminate tax incentives for companies that ship jobs overseas. He is also a strong advocate for economic fairness and author of the Buffett Rule, legislation that would force multi-million-dollar earners to pay the same tax rates as middle-class Rhode Islanders.Sheldon understands what Social Security and Medicare-the twin pillars of economic fairness and retirement security-mean to Rhode Island seniors and their families. Sheldon founded the Defend Social Security Caucus to extend the program's solvency without jeopardizing benefits. And he fought to close the Medicare prescription drug ""doughnut hole"" and to eliminate fraud and abuse-again, without cutting benefits for our seniors.Sheldon understands that in the Ocean State, our economy and our way of life depend on the health of our environment. As a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Sheldon has championed efforts to reduce carbon pollution, protect our air and water, and position Rhode Island as a leader in the clean energy economy. He founded the Senate Oceans Caucus to promote creative, bipartisan policy solutions that protect our oceans, our coasts, and the people and economies that rely on them.Janet Larsen of the Earth Policy Institute called Sheldon ""an elected official who speaks the truth.""And Sheldon understands the burden of high health care costs on everyone in Rhode Island-from the families and seniors who seek quality care, to the doctors, nurses, and hospitals that provide it.Sheldon played a pivotal role in the crafting and implementation of President Obama's Affordable Care Act, which is making affordable health care available to millions of Americans.As a founder of the Rhode Island Quality Institute, Sheldon believes that rewarding good care and reducing waste in our health care system will lower costs and improve the quality of care. Thanks in part to his support for these kinds of reforms and investments in our state, Rhode Island's knowledge and health care economy is leading the nation in this effort.Like many Rhode Islanders, Sheldon knows how devastating a cancer diagnosis can be to a family and shared his own family's story in this video. In 2013, his legislation to improve research on the deadliest forms of cancer was signed into law.Sheldon has worked to strengthen struggling schools and prevent students from falling behind. National PTA President Betsy Landers has said, ""Our nation's families are fortunate to have a true advocate for children in Senator Whitehouse."" Sheldon is also fighting to ensure that Senator Pell's legacy-the Federal Pell Grant program-remains strong so the next generation of Americans can turn the dream of a college education into a reality.A graduate of Yale University and the University of Virginia School of Law, Sheldon served as Rhode Island's Director of Business Regulation under Governor Sundlun before being recommended by Senator Pell and nominated by President Bill Clinton to be Rhode Island's United States Attorney in 1994. He was elected Attorney General of Rhode Island in 1998, a position in which he served until 2003. On November 7, 2006, Rhode Islanders elected Sheldon to the United States Senate, where he is a member of the Finance Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW), and the Budget Committee. He is the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism and of the EPW Subcommittee on Oversight.He and his wife Sandra, a marine biologist and environmental advocate, live in Newport. They have two children.Whether at one of his community dinners throughout the state, meetings with small business owners, breakfasts with Veterans, or discussions at senior centers, Sheldon is listening to Rhode Islanders-and putting their ideas to work in Washington.

He was later greeted by a spectator who said, ""I noticed you missed one."" That spectator happened to be well-known sports enthusiast and South Dakota U.S. Representative Jim Abdnor. The introduction was the start of a friendship that ignited John's career in public service.John received his undergraduate degree at Biola University and his Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of South Dakota. Upon completion of his Master's Degree in 1984, he married Kimberley Weems, a native of Doland, South Dakota.John's attraction to public service took him to Washington, D.C. to work for that sports enthusiast and then-U.S. Senator Jim Abdnor. He then served at the Small Business Administration under an appointment from President Ronald Reagan.In 1989, John and his family returned to South Dakota, where he served as the Executive Director of the South Dakota Republican Party.

John was reelected to a second term by the largest margin in South Dakota history. He returned again to Washington in 2001 to serve his third term in the House.John then honored his 1996 campaign pledge to serve only three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. After a narrow loss in a U.S. Senate race in 2002, he won his current U.S. Senate seat in 2004, when he made history by defeating a sitting U.S. Senate party leader for the first time in 52 years.In 2010, John was elected to serve a second term in the U.S. Senate in a rare unopposed race.

He attended public schools, played sports, and from an early age learned to love and value hard work. He took his first job at age 13 picking up trash and spent his teenage years bagging ice, working at the Western Auto and putting in long hours as a construction laborer.Bob graduated from the University of Tennessee in 1974 with a degree in Industrial Management, and after working four years as a construction superintendent, he started his own construction company with $8,000. The company grew as it quickly gained a reputation for meeting deadlines on time and under budget and eventually expanded to operations in 18 states. Over time, Bob's business interests evolved to acquiring and developing commercial real estate.After traveling with his church on a mission trip to Haiti in his late twenties, Bob began to take a closer look at needs in his own community. He led the creation of Chattanooga Neighborhood Enterprise, a non-profit organization that today has helped over 10,000 families secure decent, fit and affordable housing through low-interest loans and personal training in home maintenance.In 1994, Bob was appointed Tennessee Commissioner of Finance and Administration, where he served for two years in the highest appointed office in state government. As commissioner, he tightened the state's budget and helped move almost 40,000 Tennesseans off welfare and into jobs.In 2001, Bob was elected mayor of Chattanooga. He transformed Chattanooga's waterfront - attracting $2.1 billion of investment to revitalize the city, implemented merit bonus pay for teachers which dramatically raised student achievement in some of the city's most challenged schools, and worked with local law enforcement officials to cut violent crime in half.On November 7, 2006, Bob Corker was elected to serve the people of Tennessee in the United States Senate. He is a member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee and ranking member of the Special Committee on Aging.Bob and his wife, Elizabeth were married on January 10, 1987 and have two daughters, Julia and Emily.

He is Ranking Member of the Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee and the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia, and Counterterrorism.Tim's Armed Services work focuses on crafting smart defense strategy in a changing world and also enables him to tackle a personal mission - the reduction of unemployment among veterans, especially Iraq and Afghanistan-era veterans. His first piece of legislation in the Senate, the Troop Talent Act of 2013, established new standards to help active duty servicemembers attain civilian credentials for military skills to assist their transition into the workforce. In his committee role, Tim has also worked to secure key Virginia priorities in the past three defense bills, including the refueling and overhaul of the Norfolk-based U.S.S. George Washington in the 2015 Authorization and preservation of the U.S. Navy's 11-aircraft carrier fleet and thousands of jobs across Hampton Roads in the 2016 Authorization.On Foreign Relations, Tim works to enhance American diplomatic leadership, with a special focus on the Middle East and Latin America. He is a leading voice in efforts to expand the role of Congress on foreign policy and improve the way Congress and the President consult on matters of war, peace, and diplomacy. Tim has introduced bipartisan legislation to revise the War Powers Resolution of 1973 and has pushed Congress to finally vote to authorize the ongoing U.S. military action against ISIL. In addition, Tim coauthored the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, establishing the process for congressional review of the diplomatic effort to block any Iranian nuclear weapons program. He is one of the Senate's few members fluent in Spanish and serves as honorary chairman of the US-Spain Council.On the Budget Committee, Tim used his experience making tough budget decisions in local and state office in Virginia to help Congress pass a two-year budget agreement in 2013 to offset the worst impacts of sequestration that had disproportionately impacted the Commonwealth. As a harsh critic of sequestration and an advocate for biennial budgeting, Tim strongly supported the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 for continuing to scale back sequestration cuts and providing for two more years of budgetary certainty.As a new member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the 115th Congress, Tim will have the opportunity to focus on two of his longtime passions- health care and education. In this critical time for health care in America, Tim is motivated now more than ever to fight against harmful policy proposals that seek to reverse the progress we've made in increasing access to care for millions of Americans. Tim will also use his new role to look for ways to further address the opioid abuse epidemic that affects every corner of the Commonwealth.Tim is a founder and co-chair of the bipartisan Career and Technical Education (CTE) Caucus, which focuses on improving access to CTE programs to ensure that students of all ages are prepared with the skills they need for the jobs of the 21st century. Many of his proposals to advance CTE were included in the 2015 re-write of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Tim also supports expanding economic opportunity through infrastructure investment, immigration reform and smart strategies to expand affordable health care access.Tim has focused closely on climate change and its effects on Virginia, especially sea level rise and flooding. In 2014, he co-hosted a bipartisan conference that brought together policymakers, experts, and regional stakeholders to discuss strategies to combat the threat that these challenges pose to Hampton Roads.Tim grew up working in his father's ironworking shop in Kansas City. He was educated at the University of Missouri and Harvard Law School and started his public service career by taking a year off from Harvard to run a technical school founded by Jesuit missionaries in Honduras. After law school, he practiced law in Richmond for 17 years, specializing in the representation of people who had been denied housing due to their race or disability. He also began teaching part-time at the University of Richmond in 1987.Tim was first elected to office in 1994, serving as a city councilmember and then Mayor of Richmond. He became Lieutenant Governor of Virginia in 2002 and was inaugurated as Virginia's 70th Governor in 2006.Tim is married to Anne Holton, who served as Virginia Secretary of Education from 2014 until 2016. A former legal aid lawyer and juvenile court judge, Anne previously ran Great Expectations, a program for more than 500 foster children attending Virginia community colleges.

A graduate of Saint Michael's College in Colchester (1961), he received his Juris Doctor from Georgetown University Law Center (1964).  He served for eight years as State's Attorney in Chittenden County where he gained a national reputation for his law enforcement activities and was selected as one of three outstanding prosecutors in the United States in 1974. Leahy is the Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He is the senior-most member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Leahy is the Ranking Member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State Department, Foreign Operations and Related Programs. He ranks first in seniority in the Senate.Active on human rights issues, Leahy is the leading U.S. officeholder in the international campaign against the production, export and use of anti-personnel landmines.  In 1992, Leahy wrote the first law by any government to ban the export of these weapons.  He led efforts in Congress to aid mine victims by creating a special fund in the foreign aid budget, and the Leahy War Victims Fund now provides up to $14 million of relief to these victims each year.  He was instrumental in establishing programs to support humanitarian demining and played a key role in pushing for an international treaty banning anti-personnel mines.  He also wrote and enacted civilian war victims relief programs in Afghanistan and Iraq.In the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, Leahy headed the Senate's negotiations on the 2001 anti-terrorism bill, the USA PATRIOT Act.  He added checks and balances to the bill to protect civil liberties, provisions to triple staffing along the U.S.-Canada border, to authorize domestic preparedness grants to states, and to facilitate the hiring of new FBI translators.Leahy's Judiciary Committee investigation into the mass firings of U.S. Attorneys and of White House attempts to exert political influence over the Justice Department led to the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and the Department's entire top rank of political appointees in 2008.Leahy is the chief sponsor of the Innocence Protection Act, which addresses flaws in the administration of capital punishment.  Parts of Leahy's death penalty reform package, which were enacted in 2004, help reduce the risks that innocent people are executed by providing for post-conviction DNA testing and better access to competent legal counsel. A leader on Internet and technology issues, Leahy has been the Senate's leading champion of open government and of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and in 1996 was installed in the FOIA Hall of Fame in recognition of his efforts.  He is one of only two politicians ever awarded the John Peter Zenger Press Freedom Award.  An avid and accomplished photographer, Leahy's photography has been published in USA TODAY, The New York Times, Time Magazine and Roll Call.Leahy has crusaded for the protection of privacy rights, copyright protections and freedom of speech on the Internet.  He was a co-founder and remains a co-chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus.  Leahy has taken the lead on several privacy issues, including drafting legislation to address data and email privacy and security and leading the effort to enact privacy safeguards for electronic health records.Always ranked among the top environmental legislators by the nation's foremost conservation organizations, Leahy successfully opposed attempts to allow oil and gas exploration in wildlife refuges in the United States, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and the Missisquoi Wildlife Refuge in Vermont.  Leahy helped secure more than $70 million in federal funds to clean up Lake Champlain and spearheaded congressional efforts to tackle the dangers of mercury pollution.  He worked to add more than 125,000 acres to the Green Mountain National Forest, an accomplishment matched by few lawmakers of any era. Leahy led bipartisan efforts to streamline the Department of Agriculture, and the 1994 Leahy-Lugar bill reorganized the U.S. Department of Agriculture by closing 1100 offices and saving more than $2 billion.  Leahy led the successful effort to extend the Conservation Reserve Program, which assists farmers in meeting environmental objectives without reducing income.  Leahy's Farms for the Future program -- now the Farmland Protection Program, which was created in the 1990 Farm Bill -- helped preserve more than 350 Vermont farms.  He played a crucial role in enactment and implementation of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact and also worked with others in the Vermont Congressional Delegation in establishing the Milk Income Loss Compensation (MILC) program, modeled on the Compact.  Leahy also is the father of the national organic standards and labeling program, which took effect in October 2002.Leahy co-chairs the Senate National Guard Caucus and led in ensuring that members of the National Guard in Vermont and across the nation receive the necessary resources to fulfill their heightened missions after 9/11.  In 2003 the National Guard Association presented Leahy with its highest individual honor, the Harry S. Truman Award, for his ""sustained contributions of exceptional and far-reaching magnitude to the defense and security of the United States in a manner worthy of recognition at the national level.""Patrick Leahy has been married to Marcelle Pomerleau Leahy since 1962.

Serving as a member of Senate Democratic leadership since 2007, Patty has established herself as a tireless and effective leader on education, transportation, budget issues, port security, healthcare, women, and veterans issues.In addition to being the first female Senator from Washington state, Patty served as the first female Chair of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee during the 112th Congress and served as the first female Chair of the Senate Budget Committee during the 113th Congress. She is currently Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.Patty was born and raised in Bothell, Washington. Her dad ran a five and dime store on Main Street, where she and her siblings all worked growing up. As a twin and one of seven children, she quickly learned the value of a strong work ethic and a country that supports those who fall on hard times when her father fell ill when she was 15. Patty's father - a World War II veteran and a Purple Heart recipient - was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and in a few short years, his illness got so bad he couldn't work anymore.  Patty's mother, who had stayed home to raise their family, had to take care of him while also working to support their family. She found some work, but it didn't pay enough to support Patty and her six brothers and sisters-and a husband with growing medical bills. Thankfully, they lived in a country where the government didn't just say ""tough luck."" Patty's family received some help from the VA for their father's medical care, but for several months her family had to rely on food stamps. However, thanks to a program established by the federal government, Patty's mother was able to go back to school in order to find a better paying job.  And thanks to federal grants and student loans, Patty and her siblings were all able to attend college. While attending Washington State University, Patty took an internship in the psychiatric ward of the Seattle VA. It was there she personally witnessed the sacrifices of young Vietnam War veterans.Never planning to enter politics, in the 1980's a state politician told her she ""couldn't make a difference"" when she went to Olympia as a parent to advocate for a local preschool program targeted by state budget cuts.  Patty responded by organizing a grassroots coalition of 13,000 parents that fought successfully to save the program. Patty went on to serve on the Shoreline School Board, and in 1988 was elected to the Washington State Senate. In 1992, she ran for the United States Senate as a voice for Washington families who were not being heard. Dramatically outspent, Patty ran a grassroots campaign of family, friends, supporters, and public interest groups to beat a 10-year veteran of the U.S. House of Representatives. Patty was re-elected in 1998, 2004, and 2010.As a unique voice in the United States Senate, Patty is known for her down-to-earth, determined style. She's been called ""a workhorse, not a show horse"" by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer for her intense, behind-the-scenes efforts to get the job done. She has also been described as ""tenacious"" in her work to address Washington state's needs by the Seattle Times. Patty is often looked to by colleagues and the media in Washington D.C. for her ability to articulate how complex issues affect every day American families. Recently, Patty reflected on her life experiences and how that impacts the decisions she makes as a U.S. Senator today-""I know the support we got from our government was the difference between seven kids who might not have graduated from high school or college-and the seven adults we've grown up to be today-all college graduates, all working hard and paying taxes, and all doing our best to contribute back to our communities. So this is the primary prism I view our nation's budget through.  And it's what guides me as I work in the Senate to impact the choices we make.  Not that government can or should solve every problem-of course it shouldn't, and it can't. But that we are a nation that has always come together to stand with families like mine.   To invest in our people, our communities, our future-and to build the most robust middle class the world has ever seen.""Patty met her husband of over 40 years, Rob Murray, while attending Washington State University. They have two grown children, Sara and Randy. Patty enjoys fishing, exploring Washington state's great outdoors and spending time with her family."

Byrd. For Senator Manchin, serving as West Virginia's Senator is truly an honor and a privilege.Born and raised in the small coal mining town of Farmington, W.Va., Sen. Manchin grew up learning the values that all West Virginians share - family, common sense, fairness and hard work. As a small businessman, he learned firsthand from his grandfather, Papa Joe, who was an Italian immigrant and the town grocer, the importance of serving the public. As a young man, his beloved grandmother, Mama Kay, inspired Senator Manchin's belief in public service through her unflagging compassion and desire to help those less fortunate. More than anything, it is his family and the values he learned growing up among the hardworking men and women of West Virginia that define who Senator Manchin is and the public servant he strives to be.From his days as a state legislator to his six years as Governor to his current role, Senator Manchin has always been committed to his philosophy of ""retail government""-- in other words, connecting with all of his constituents and making service to them his top priority.Throughout his public life, he has never let politics or ideology stand in the way of commonsense solutions. Instead, he believes that only by putting politics aside and working hard to bring people together can we do what is right for West Virginia and the nation.He began his tenure as West Virginia's 34th governor in January 2005. Then-Governor Manchin approved millions of dollars in tax relief for West Virginia's citizens and businesses, fixed the state's workers' compensation system, established the first comprehensive teacher pay package in more than 15 years and dramatically decreased the state's debt. In six years, more than $13 billion in business investments were made, and West Virginia was often cited nationally for its strong fiscal management.As a Senator, Joe Manchin is committed to bringing this same spirit of bipartisanship to Washington. As he has done throughout his entire life, he remains committed to working with Republicans and Democrats to find commonsense solutions to the problems our country faces and is working hard to usher in a new bipartisan spirit in the Senate and Congress. Legislatively, job creation is Senator Manchin's top priority, and he believes that government should act as a partner, not an adversary, in helping to create the environment that produces good American jobs. Senator Manchin also firmly believes that our nation can and must do what he did in West Virginia - put our fiscal house in order. He believes we must find commonsense ways to cut spending while keeping our promises to our seniors and veterans by protecting Social Security and Medicare. Senator Manchin is strongly committed to developing a balanced national energy plan that utilizes all of our resources and recognizes that fossil fuels will be a vital part of our energy mix for decades to come. He believes that a balanced, commonsense approach that considers the needs of our environment and the demands of our economy, can and must be developed if we are to achieve energy independence within this generation.Senator Manchin currently serves on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senate Select Committe on Intelligence, the Senate Committee on Appropriations, and the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs - four critical committees that tackle the important work of addressing our nation's energy needs, standing up for our veterans, and overseeing discretionary spending and intelligence activities."

Enzi has been a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, since his arrival in the senate in 1997. Having served both as Chairman and Ranking Member, Enzi led the Senate in its efforts to help ensure that everyone, no matter their age, can receive a quality education. Enzi worked to help provide Americans access to affordable, quality health care while protecting workers and providing them training to get the best jobs. Enzi also worked to oversee the biggest revision to pension laws in 30 years to strengthen funding rules to secure the retirements of millions of Americans. Enzi's committee also led the way to making the first revision to mine safety laws in 28 years by promoting the use of new technologies to improve mine safety and save lives. During his time as chairman of the HELP Committee 37 bills were reported out of the committee, 23 bills passed the Senate, 352 nominations were reported favorably and 15 laws came through the committee that were signed by President Bush.

He went on to complete five years of service as a naval flight officer, serve three tours of duty in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, and continued to serve in the Naval Reserve as a P-3 aircraft mission commander until retiring with the rank of captain in 1991 after 23 years of military service. With the war winding down in Southeast Asia, Tom Carper moved to Delaware in 1973 where he earned his M.B.A. at the University of Delaware. Today, he and his wife of 30 years, Martha, live in Wilmington and are the proud parents of two sons. Senator Carper travels from Wilmington to Washington each day on an Amtrak train.His career in public service began in 1976 when he was elected to the first of three terms as Delaware's state treasurer at the age of 29. Six years later, with that credit rating restored to a respectable ""AA"" he ran for - and was elected - to Delaware's at-large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.Senator Carper went on to serve five terms as a U.S. congressman. In 1991, then-Congressman Carper led a bipartisan, six-member congressional delegation of Vietnam veterans back to Southeast Asia to search for U.S. soldiers whose remains were never recovered and listed as MIAs. During that trip, the group met with the new Vietnamese General Secretary Do Muoi and helped lay the groundwork for normalizing relations between the United States and Vietnam. Tom Carper was then elected the 78th governor of Delaware in 1992 and served two terms in that role. As governor, he pursued a common-sense agenda that led to eight balanced budgets, tax cuts in seven of those eight years, and major increases in employment. Governor Carper led the effort to strengthen the state's ""rainy day"" fund and boost Delaware's credit rating to ""AAA"" for the first time in state history, while helping to overhaul the state's education system and to implement welfare reform initiatives in Delaware and the nation.During his second term as governor, Tom Carper was selected by his colleagues to serve as vice-chairman, then as chairman, of the National Governors' Association (NGA). After serving as chairman, he led the NGA's 'Center for Best Practices,' which focused on developing and implementing innovative solutions to policy challenges faced by governors across the nation. From 1994-1998, he served as a member of Amtrak's board of directors and, later, as founding vice-chairman of the American Legacy Foundation to combat youth smoking and as vice-chairman of Jobs for America's Graduates, a national non-profit to reduce high school dropouts.On Jan. 3, 2001, Governor Carper stepped down two weeks early to become Delaware's junior senator. He was reelected in 2006, and with his reelection in November 2012 he has been elected to state-wide public office in Delaware 13 times. When Senator Joe Biden stepped down to become vice president in January 2009, Tom Carper became Delaware's senior senator.In his time in the U.S. Senate, Senator Carper has worked extensively on reforming our health care system, improving our environment, and ensuring that federal programs are run efficiently and effectively. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Carper helped craft the Affordable Care Act with a focus on how to improve our health care system by reducing costs, getting better results, and empowering consumers with the tools and resources they need to achieve better health and wellness. Senator Carper fought to include provisions on workplace wellness and menu labeling in the health care reform law, and he continues to be a leader in ensuring that the Affordable Care Act is implemented effectively.As the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Carper leads the fight to protect our environment and clean up our air as the committee's ranking member in the 115th Congress. During his time on the committee, Senator Carper successfully defended common sense clean air regulations from misguided attempts to repeal them, and he continues to push for meaningful protections that limit carbon pollution, regulate cross-state air pollution and help stem the tide of climate change. He led the effort to pass the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act with Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio), which has cleaned up millions of old, dirty diesel engines to help save lives and improve public health. Senator Carper also helped broker the compromise that created our country's highest fuel efficiency standards in a generation, saving Americans billions of dollars at the pump.  Senator Carper also serves as a senior member on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, having served as the committee's chairman in the 113th Congress and ranking member in the 114th Congress. In his continued work on the committee, he focuses on protecting our country from threats to our national security, as well as ensuring federal government programs are efficient and using taxpayer dollars wisely. Senator Carper continues to champion postal reform with the goal of protecting the U.S. Postal Service from collapse and ensuring it remains a robust American institution for generations to come. He has also supported legislation to improve cybersecurity across the federal government and ensure we are doing all we can to respond to the growing threats our country faces in cyberspace.During more than 30 years of public service, Senator Carper has worked tirelessly to develop practical solutions to real problems. His ability to work across party lines has earned him a reputation for consensus-building that is unique in today's political climate. The Washington Post's late David Broder calls him ""a notably effective and non-partisan leader, admired and trusted on both sides of the aisle."""

""If we could just remember that, we'd sure get a lot more done.""It's that kind of perspective that has earned Nelson a reputation as a thoughtful, moderate voice in an increasingly partisan political world.Nelson's public service career began in 1972, with his election to the Florida Legislature. He then served six terms in the U.S. Congress representing Orlando and the Space Coast, becoming an early champion of the environment.In 1994, Nelson was elected to the Florida Cabinet as state Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and Fire Marshal. During his six years in the post, he showed he was a common-sense problem solver and strong consumer advocate.Nelson was first elected to the U.S. Senate in November 2000. Since then, he's stood up to the insurance companies, Wall Street banks and Big Oil. He's exposed the lies of BP about the Gulf spill.

Elected to the United States Senate in 2000, she is respected for her ability to build coalitions to get things done for Michigan and our nation.As Ranking Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and as a member of the Senate Energy, Finance, and Budget Committees, she has a powerful and unique role to play in shaping our nation's manufacturing, health care, and agriculture policies, which are so critical to our future.She is a true friend and fighter for Michigan.Growing up in Clare, Debbie Stabenow learned the value of a hard-day's work from her parents.  She graduated at the top of her class from Clare High School and went on to receive her Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Michigan State University. She worked with youth in the public schools before running for public office.Senator Stabenow was inspired to first run for office after leading a successful effort to stop the closure of a local nursing home. She was elected to the Ingham County Board of Commissioners when she was 24 years old, and in just two years, was elected Chair of the Board. She was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives where she served for twelve years (1979-90) and to the State Senate where she served for four years (1991-94). Elected to the U.S. Congress in 1996 representing Michigan's Eighth Congressional District, she made history in 2000 when she became the first woman from the State of Michigan elected to the United States Senate.Today, in addition to serving as Michigan's senior U.S. Senator, Debbie Stabenow is a member of the Senate leadership. As Chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Center, she makes sure there is Michigan voice at the table and that Congress' priorities stay in line with the priorities of middle class families.Creating jobs in Michigan is Senator Stabenow's top priority. She has committed herself to bringing jobs back to Michigan and to ensuring that Michigan is a destination for the jobs of the future.  As new international trade agreements are being negotiated, Senator Stabenow has called for the removal of trade barriers that hurt American businesses. And she has made clear that if a trade agreement doesn't work for our workers, then it doesn't work for America, which is why she supports a race-to-the-top framework that would compel our trading partners to raise their standards on wages, environmental responsibility and working conditions.Senator Stabenow believes that high-quality, affordable health care should be available to every American. She worked to ensure that the Affordable Care Act promoted comprehensive coverage for women, including maternity care, and she supported provisions that lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors. She also made mental health parity in the law a top priority. In 2014 she successfully passed legislation that included language based on her Excellence in Mental Health Act, which provides funding for an expansion of mental health services.  As Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care, Senator Stabenow is a champion for Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. She has been recognized for her success making prescription drugs more affordable.She is also a leading advocate of community health centers, which provide affordable, high-quality care in over 180 communities in Michigan. As part of the Affordable Care Act, Senator Stabenow ensured that these health centers would get immediate assistance to expand their operations and provide primary care services to up to 25 million Americans in need. Senator Stabenow knows that we don't have an economy unless we make things and grow things - and this is especially key in Michigan's economy. So in addition to taking actions to strengthen Great Lakes manufacturing, she has been a forceful advocate for policies that will power growth in Michigan agriculture - the state's second biggest source of jobs.In writing the 2014 Farm Bill, Senator Stabenow streamlined more than 100 programs while making historic investments in land and water conservation, clean energy, local food systems, specialty crops and is helping to reinvigorate the economies of small towns and rural communities through her support of cutting-edge research and biobased manufacturing. After her election to the U.S. Senate, the first bill Senator Stabenow passed into law was a ban on oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes.  The Stabenow-authored Farm Bill will help protect the Great Lakes and other precious natural resources by strengthening conservation programs by bringing together farmers, businesses, conservationists, university researchers state agencies and nonprofits as stakeholders in the quality of Great Lakes water. With funds secured through Farm Bill programs, they are working together to provide healthy soil, clean water and wildlife habitat.As Co-Chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, Senator Stabenow is also leading the fight to protect our waters from the threat posed by invasive species, and the risks that come from oil pipelines and a nuclear waste facility the Canada government is proposing to build on the shores of Lake Huron.  In recent years, no one has fought harder to secure federal funding in support of the Great Lakes, from cleaning up and restoring our waterways to modernizing the coastal infrastructure that links Michigan businesses to the global economy.A musician at heart, Senator Stabenow sings and plays both the piano and the guitar. Her home is in Lansing, where she is a lifelong Methodist and a member of Grace United Methodist Church. She has two grown children, Todd and Michelle; a daughter-in-law, Sara; a son-in-law, Scott; and four beautiful grandchildren."

I've been a small-business owner, a non-profit executive, a community activist, and a public servant. I'm a hard worker, an organizer, a problem-solver - and yes, an optimist, even when it's tough to be one. Like most women, I've often had to improvise and juggle it all in the faith that things will somehow work out.I consider myself lucky to be a Minnesotan by choice. I was born and raised in New Mexico, where my parents taught me about the value and responsibility of giving back to my community. My husband Archie and I first came to Minnesota 34 years ago, when I started a marketing job at General Mills. We rolled into Minnesota in an old, beat-up, orange car with a busted defroster, which meant we had to keep the windows rolled down even when it was 20 below. Yep, that was us.Archie and I started our family in St. Louis Park, where we had our sons Mason and Sam. All these years later, our family has grown to include two wonderful daughters-in-law, and we're blessed to all live within five miles of each other.After a few years, I started my own small business and grew it successfully, all while volunteering in our community - often with a kid or two in tow. I left the private sector when I had the opportunity to expand health care access for women, joining Planned Parenthood as an executive. Then I was called into public service, first as chief of staff to then-Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, then as chief of staff to Governor Mark Dayton.In 2014, Governor Dayton asked me to step up yet again and serve as Minnesota's lieutenant governor, which I had the great privilege of doing for the last three years. Being lieutenant governor is like being invited into Minnesota's living room- traveling to every part of our amazing state, meeting people from every walk of life, listening to people talk about their hopes and dreams, their fears and concerns, what they were doing and how we might be able to help. I did my best to take what I learned back to the State Capitol, working every day on solutions that would help improve people's lives.While we still face many challenges as a state, I'm proud of what we accomplished together- working with Governor Dayton to bring Minnesota's unemployment rate down to one of the lowest in America, making our tax system fairer for the middle class, helping close the economic gaps between white people and people of color, and solving the budget deficit we inherited. No wonder we were just named the ""Best Run State in America"". A lot done. So much more to do.And now I have the privilege to serve as your Senator. While I never anticipated or planned for this, my life has prepared me well for it. I've never been one to shrink from a challenge or opportunity to live what I've learned from my parents, my family, and the people of Minnesota- work hard, be humble, treat people with respect, and do what you can to help improve people's lives. Those are the values that have guided me in my life and now guide me in my work as your Senator. I look forward to meeting many of you in the months ahead, earning your trust, and serving you as best I can."

Living off of a rickety old campaign bus, he and his family campaigned tirelessly on a common-sense platform of restoring the Constitution to its rightful place and encouraging a more constructive politics where every public official works to make the American Dream achievable for every family. He believes in term limits and a humbler Washington, where the federal government does fewer things, but the more important things, more urgently, more transparently, and with less partisan screaming. Healthy lives are lived primarily in the private sector, and the vast majority of good policy is created at the state and local level -- and Washington should get better at talking honestly about these essential American realities.A fifth-generation Nebraskan, Ben grew up walking beans and detasseling corn, experiences that taught him the value of hard work. A graduate of Fremont High School, he was recruited to wrestle at Harvard and then earned a PhD in American history at Yale. Ben comes to the Senate having spent the last five years as a college president. When he was recruited to take over the failing Midland University, Ben was just 37 years old, making him one of the youngest college presidents in the nation. The 130-year-old Lutheran college was on the verge of bankruptcy when he arrived, but became one of the fastest-growing higher education institutions in the country by the time of his departure.Most of his career has been spent guiding companies and institutions through times of crisis with straight talk about the core issues. He has worked with the Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey and Company, as well as private equity firms and not-for-profit organizations, to tackle failing strategies across a broad array of sectors and nations.Ben believes that we have a moral obligation to pass along a country as great and free and opportunity-filled to the next generation as we were blessed to inherit from our grandparents. This will require a more serious Congress, committed to reforming entitlements, telling the truth about fake federal budgets, modernizing national security for the age of global terror networks, and helping the next generation recover a sense of optimism about the American Dream for everyone of every race in every neighborhood."

He served as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the 113th Congress. The Committee is one of the oldest and most revered Committees in the Senate, at a time when world affairs has a dramatic impact on our economy at home. He has earned a national reputation for his international leadership in the Senate, which pairs with his long-time reputation as a fighter for New Jersey families who puts their economic security ahead of powerful special interests.A product of New Jersey's public schools and a graduate of the state's universities, Bob learned early on the importance of standing up for what's right, no matter how powerful the opposition. He first entered public service as a 19-year-old college student when his high school would not provide books to students who could not afford them. Bob launched a successful petition drive to reform the local school board and a year later won a seat on that very board. He stood up to corruption in Union City and went on to become its mayor, a state legislator and was elected to Congress in 1992. He quickly rose to leadership positions and has given New Jerseyans a seat at the table during critical negotiations on every issue since then- war and peace, jobs and the economy, education, health care, veterans issues, world affairs, transportation and housing.Senator Menendez's career has been a tribute to his desire to protect the powerless from the powerful and ensure fairness for every American. He led the fight in Congress to make sure New Jersey received its fair share of recovery funds to help communities rebuild after Superstorm Sandy, chaired Senate Banking Committee hearings to hold the administration accountable for getting  relief resources out of Washington, and passed landmark bipartisan legislation providing relief to homeowners hit with unreasonably high flood insurance premiums.The son of immigrants, Bob understands the importance of New Jersey's Liberty State Park, in the shadow of Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, at the gateway for millions of immigrants who came to this nation seeking the American Dream and a better life for them and their children. That's why he was one of eight Senators who wrote and fought for comprehensive immigration reform legislation that passed the Senate in 2013 with an overwhelming bipartisan show of support.While Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he established himself as a new foreign policy leader for a new century, seeking to do globally what he has done in New Jersey - supporting the most vulnerable in our society and lending a voice to those least able to speak for themselves. He has advocated for women and children struggling with oppressive poverty in Central America and Africa, and stood by democracy activists struggling to reform governments from Cuba to China to Russia. In addition, he has evoked a strong national security posture in the face of tyrannical leaders of Russia, Iran and Syria. He has led the Foreign Relations Committee in bipartisan efforts, reaching across the aisle in September 2013 to unanimously pass a resolution to allow the President to use military force in Syria, which led to the end of the use of chemical weapons against civilians. Bob uses economic statecraft to realize the nexus between economic issues and foreign policy to allow America - and New Jersey - to prosper in our intertwined global economyBob has been widely recognized for his leadership on promoting safe and healthy families. He has championed legislation to support mothers suffering from postpartum depression, help families meet the challenges of autism, and keep young athletes safe from harm on the playing field. He serves on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and has championed increased consumer protection and corporate accountability, fairness in lending, affordable housing, and comprehensive approaches to community revitalization. He served as Chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation and Community Development where he fought for smart growth, jobs for the 21st Century and updating our aging transportation system. As a member of the Finance Committee, he has sponsored legislation increasing access to health care, advocated for fairness in the tax code to help middle class families get college educations and be able to retire, and Bob has pushed for trade initiatives to ensure America's global competitiveness.Bob received his B.A. from St. Peter's College in Jersey City and his law degree from Rutgers University. He currently lives in Paramus and has two children, Alicia and Robert."

In 2013, as chair of the sub-committee on personnel, she held the first Senate hearing on the issue of sexual assault in the military in almost a decade. Gillibrand went on to lead the fight in reforming how the military handles sexual assault cases, building a broad bipartisan coalition of 55 Senators in support of legislation to remove sexual assault cases from the chain of command.Senator Gillibrand is also leading the fight to end the sexual assault epidemic on our college campuses. Along with Senator Claire McCaskill, Kirsten has won the support of a broad bipartisan group of Senate co-sponsors for the Campus Accountability and Safety Act designed to hold colleges accountable and to flip the incentives so that colleges no longer sweep sexual assaults under the rug.As the mother of two young children, Senator Gillibrand knows that working families are struggling in this difficult economy and has a legislative agenda that puts middle class and working families first.  As a champion for the economic empowerment of women & working families, Senator Gillibrand has proposed her Opportunity Agenda to re-write the rules of the workplace to ensure that every working woman has the ability to remain in the workforce and earn her full economic potential. This agenda includes providing paid family & medical leave, raising the minimum wage, making quality child care affordable, creating universal pre-K, and ensuring equal pay for equal work. Gillibrand's FAMILY Act would create a national paid leave program for all workers for less than the cost of a cup of coffee a week per employee.After winning 58 votes for her gun trafficking legislation in 2013, coming just two votes shy of overcoming a filibuster, Senator Gillibrand introduced the Hadiya Pendleton and Nyasia Pryear-Yard Gun Trafficking and Crime Prevention Act with Senator Mark Kirk in 2015. This legislation would finally make gun trafficking a federal crime and give law enforcement the tools it needs to stop the flow of illegal guns into our communities. Also in 2015, Senator Gillibrand introduced the CARERS Act with Senators Cory Booker and Rand Paul to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule 2 drug and enable our families to access critical treatment in states where medical marijuana is legal.  As the first New York Senator to sit on the Agriculture Committee in nearly 40 years, Senator Gillibrand is giving New York families the seat at the table they deserve. She worked hard to strengthen the 2012 Farm Bill for New York by strengthening specialty crops, expanding rural broadband and improving recovery efforts from natural disasters. She also led the unsuccessful fight to stop billions in devastating cuts to nutritional assistance for struggling children, seniors and veterans.From her seat on the Aging Committee, Senator Gillibrand is committed to fighting on behalf of seniors, working to lower the cost of prescription drugs, make long-term care more affordable so seniors can remain independent for as long as they are able, and protect seniors from financial fraud. Senator Gillibrand is fighting to ensure that drug information provided to seniors and all consumers is clear, concise and up-to-date.After attending Albany's Academy of Holy Names, Senator Gillibrand graduated in 1984 from Emma Willard School in Troy, New York, the first all women's high school in the United States. A magna cum laude graduate of Dartmouth College in 1988, Gillibrand went on to receive her law degree from the UCLA School of Law in 1991 and served as a law clerk on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.After working as an attorney in New York City for more than a decade, Senator Gillibrand served as Special Counsel to United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Andrew Cuomo during the Clinton Administration.

Congressman Issa and his wife Kathy live in Vista, CA. They have one son, William, and celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary in 2010.As a senior in high school, Issa enlisted in the United States Army. Through his Army service, he received an ROTC scholarship and graduated with a degree in business from Sienna Heights University in Adrian, Michigan. Upon graduation, Issa was commissioned as an Army officer, and ultimately obtained the rank of captain. He completed his active-duty military service in 1980 and turned his interests to the private sector.At the height of his career in business, Issa served as CEO of California-based Directed Electronics, a company that Issa founded and built in the mid-1990s to become the nation's largest manufacturer of vehicle anti-theft devices, including the highly-successful Viper system. In 1994, Issa was named Entrepreneur of the Year by Inc. Magazine, Ernst & Young and The San Diego Union-Tribune. During his leadership of Directed Electronics, Issa served as chairman of the Consumer Electronics Association, an organization of 2000 companies within the consumer technology industry that hosts the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. When he stepped down as CEO to serve as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Directed Electronics employed nearly 200 people.As a Congressman and leader in California grassroots politics, Issa has championed the cause of smart, efficient government, and has pushed legislation to balance the federal budget and promote transparency across the federal bureaucracy. In 2003, Issa was the architect behind the successful popular uprising to recall former Democratic California Governor Gray Davis. Issa currently is a member of the House Judiciary Committee -- where he serves as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet -- as well as the House Foreign Affairs and House Oversight and Government Reform Committees. He served as the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee during the 112th and 113th Congresses. Previously, Issa served on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Energy & Commerce Committee, and the Small Business Committee.As the holder of 37 patents himself, Issa has been vigilant about protecting the intellectual property rights of artists and other entrepreneurs to help protect America's position at the forefront of innovation and creativity in the entertainment and technology industries. His successful efforts to fight human trafficking along the United States border has resulted in tougher laws, stiffer penalties, and more consistent enforcement. His watchful concern to guarantee that U.S. taxpayers receive the royalties they are owed from mineral interests on federal lands exposed fraud and mismanagement at the Mineral Management Service (MMS) in 2006. In 2008, when Congress was asked to pass the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in the wake of an historic financial crisis, Issa stood by his instincts as a businessman and opposed giving a blank-check bailout to Wall Street - he voted against all bailouts during the financial crisis. Refusing to give up and concede to those who favored a bailout-centered response to this and future financial failures, Issa put forward a proposal to create a bipartisan commission to uncover the root causes of the financial crisis. This idea was passed into law in early 2009 and the investigation commenced in January 2010. Issa expects the results will reveal government mistakes and protect U.S. taxpayers from future runaway government intervention in the financial and housing markets.Recognizing his success as a Congressional watchdog of taxpayer dollars, at the beginning of the 111th Congress House Republicans tapped Issa to serve as the top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is the main investigative committee of the United States House of Representatives charged with the protecting the interests of U.S. taxpayers and eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in the federal bureaucracy. Under his leadership, the committee undertook numerous detailed investigations of the Countrywide Financial VIP Program that benefited government officials with special reduced-rate mortgage loans, the illegal use of taxpayer dollars by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), the decades-old misplaced government agenda to manipulate the U.S. housing market through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that created the housing crisis, the politicization of science at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and a broad investigation into the financial crisis of 2008-2009. As a fiscal conservative committed firmly to low taxes and free markets, Issa has opposed the rise of out-of-control government spending and fought tirelessly for the responsible, transparent use of taxpayer dollars."

A Division I soccer scholarship was his ticket to becoming the first person in his family to go to college. During college, he worked as an unpaid intern in the office of his representative, Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher, and so was on Capitol Hill on September 11, 2001. This inspired his first legislative achievement- using his Student Government Association position to create a public-private college scholarship program for students who lost parents in the attacks.After earning undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Maryland, he returned to the East Bay to serve as a prosecutor in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office for seven years.  He also served as chairman of the Dublin Heritage & Cultural Arts Commission, on the Dublin Planning Commission, and was elected to the Dublin City Council.Eric Swalwell in 2012 was elected to represent California's Fifteenth Congressional District, which includes a large part of the East Bay. Now in his second term, he's working hard to bring new energy, ideas, and a problem-solving spirit to Congress, with a focus on advancing policies that support equality, opportunity, and security.Congressman Swalwell serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and believes protecting Americans is Congress' most solemn duty. He is the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), responsible for the oversight, policy, activities, and budget of the CIA. He also serves on the House Judiciary Committee, where his experience as a prosecutor and as a son and brother of law enforcement officers informs his perspective on criminal justice reform while he also address issues including voting rights, LGBT equality, comprehensive immigration reform, and protecting a woman's right to make her own health care decisions. An up-and-coming leader in the House, he is co-chair of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, which makes committee assignments and sets the caucus' policy agenda. He also chairs the Future Forum, a group of more than 20 young Democratic Members of Congress focused on issues and opportunities for millennial Americans including student loan debt and home ownership. But in keeping with his promise to work across the aisle, in his first term, Congressman Swalwell co-founded the bipartisan United Solutions Caucus to bring new Members together; the group meets regularly to advance common-sense solutions and overcome the partisan divide. And in his second term, Swalwell cofounded the bipartisan Sharing Economy Caucus to explore how this burgeoning new economic sector can benefit more Americans.Congressman Swalwell's first-term legislative accomplishments include two of his bills signed into law - tied for the most bills signed from any freshman Member of his class - including one that incentivized charitable giving after Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines. And, while serving on the Homeland Security Committee in his first term, he led a successful effort opposing a TSA proposal to allow certain knives aboard airplanes and advocated for enhancing airport perimeter security with innovative technological solutions.Even while addressing national and international issues, Congressman Swalwell remains rooted in the region he represents. He flies home almost every weekend, and has been a leader in adopting social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat as well as technology like Skype to stay in constant contact with constituents."

He has been recognized locally and nationally for his stance on common sense gun reform, juvenile justice, and championing solutions that will make the U.S. economy even stronger to bring better-paying jobs to the American people.For instance, following the Pulse Nightclub shooting in 2016, Rep. Cardenas reaffirmed his stance on national issues by pushing Congress to act on a resolution he introduced on the House floor during the 114th Congress.

This bill, which has a companion bill in the Senate as led by Sen. Chris Murphy (CT) and Sen. Cory Booker (NJ), would ensure much-needed health and mental care coverage for youth upon reentering the community from incarceration. The resolution acted as an extension of his work within the bipartisan Crime Prevention and Youth Development Caucus, which he co-founded along with Rep. David Reichert of Washington during the 113th Congress.  During the 113th Congress, Rep. Cardenas also founded the bipartisan Congressional Student-Athlete Protection Caucus along with Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, underscoring his dedication to fostering America's youth through bicameral support. And when it comes to bringing solutions for a stronger economy and more jobs, Rep.

The caucus focuses on strengthening relationships and business opportunities between the United States and Central and South American countries. Rep. Cardenas is also a member of- the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues; the Congressional Hispanic Caucus; the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus; the LGBT Equality Caucus; and the Small Business Caucus, amongst many others.Before representing California's 29th district in Congress, Rep. Cardenas was first elected to the California State Assembly in 1996. He went on to serve three terms in the assembly and was later elected to the Los Angeles City Council, in 2003. An engineering degree and a business background prepared him for the day-to-day duties of an elected official, while his experience allowed him to find practical and realistic solutions to difficult problems. Born in Pacoima, Rep. Cardenas was raised with ten brothers and sisters and still resides in the San Fernando Valley with his wife, Norma, and their children.Having served over 20 years in public office, Rep.

Her Los Angeles County-based district covers several cities and communities in the San Gabriel Valley - El Monte, West Covina, Covina, Baldwin Park, Azusa, Duarte, Irwindale, Industry, La Puente, Avocado Heights, West Puente Valley, Valinda, Glendora, San Dimas, La Verne and Monrovia.Napolitano is the most senior California member of the U.S. House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure where she currently serves as the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, which oversees EPA's Clean Water Act and US Army Corps of Engineers water programs.Recently as a conferee to the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) House and Senate Conference Committee, Napolitano was able to secure major victories for California, which will receive over $26 billion to fix crumbling roads, bridges, and transit systems. $450 million per year of this funding will go to the Los Angeles region for transit funding, benefiting Foothill Transit, LA Metro, and Metrolink. Funds will also relieve congestion and reduce the negative impacts her district takes on as a primary shipping corridor from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.Napolitano also serves on the House Committee on Natural Resources and is a long-time advocate for conservation, water recycling, desalination, and groundwater management as solutions to Southern California's water needs.She introduced H.R. 291, the Water in the 21st Century Act, which would provide $700 million in grants and $500 million in loans for water recycling, groundwater management, storm water, and water infrastructure projects.Congresswoman Napolitano is perhaps best known for her groundbreaking work on mental health. Her 2001 pilot program providing mental health and suicide prevention services on-site in four schools has expanded to twenty-five K-12 schools throughout the San Gabriel Valley and Southeast LA County with assistance from Los Angeles County Mental Health, which now serves as a model for H.R. 1211, the Mental Health in Schools Act.As the founder and Chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, she was active in securing mental health parity in the Affordable Care Act, and she dedicates tremendous energy to promoting mental health legislation and working with key players to increase funding and access to mental health services.Napolitano was appointed by Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi under the direction of Vice President Joe Biden to serve as a Vice-Chair of the House Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, following the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, CT. Her main focus on the task force is the intersection of mental illness and gun violence, most notably suicide prevention.In January 2016, Napolitano met with President Obama, fellow Task Force members, and other Democratic colleagues, to dialogue on possible executive actions. She then joined the President at the White House on January 5, 2016, for his announcement of new executive actions to curb gun violence and make communities safer. Napolitano ensured that adding mental health services was a component of those comprehensive actions to prevent senseless gun deaths. She remains strongly committed to expanding background checks and other measures to keep firearms out of the hands of those who might use them to harm themselves or others.Napolitano is also the founder and Co-Chair of the Congressional Youth Challenge Caucus, which supports Youth Challenge- a program run by the National Guard cadre using military discipline and education to help at-risk youth complete high school to emerge better armed with knowledge and training for success.Congresswoman Napolitano is also deeply aware of the issues facing Hispanic families in her district. She served as the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and still actively participates in Caucus business.During her tenure as Chairwoman, Napolitano played a key role in working with President George W. Bush and congressional leadership to reauthorize the Voting Right Act of 1965 and fought for a Democratic immigration overhaul proposal that would have created a guest worker program and provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Grace Flores Napolitano was born in Brownsville, Texas. After high school, she married and moved with her husband to California where they raised 5 children.She began her political career in 1986 as a member of the Norwalk City Council, and in 1989 Napolitano's fellow council members selected her to serve as Mayor. During her tenure, she addressed the city's need for jobs and reliable public transportation.Napolitano was elected in 1992 to the California Assembly, where she quickly earned a reputation as a hard worker and champion for international trade and economic expansion, environmental protection, transportation, immigration, small businesses, and women's issues.As a member of the House of Representatives, Congresswoman Napolitano has dedicated herself to improving the lives of returning veterans and their families, standing up for labor unions, bringing sustainable water solutions to Southern California, and improving mental health care for all.She has served the people of Los Angeles County for thirty years and is currently in her tenth term in Congress."

Her interest in public affairs and service grew out of her experiences as a social worker, parent, youth mentor, and military spouse.

She graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a degree in sociology.  After college she worked with at-risk youths in Israel and also lived on a kibbutz.  Susan returned to the United States and she earned her master's degree in social work at the University of North Carolina.  When her husband Steve was stationed in Japan for his military service, Susan and their sons, Jeff and Ben, joined him.  The Davis family later settled in mid-city San Diego in 1972 and Susan and Steve have lived in the same house ever since.  Today, Susan and Steve are the proud grandparents of Henry, Jane and Theo.Prior to Congress, Susan served in the California State Assembly (1994-2000).  She served three terms and focused on what would become her signature issues - education, health care, and consumer protection.  She chaired the Committee on Consumer Protection, Government Efficiency, and Economic Development.  In the House, as she has throughout her public service, Susan has approached legislating as a bipartisan consensus builder achieving legislative successes in education, military families and veterans support and health care.Education - In addition to her state legislative experience, Susan brought to Congress nine years of experience as a member of the San Diego Unified Board of Education (1983-1992).  As a senior member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, Susan has played a key role in bringing reforms and improvements to primary, secondary and higher education.  She wrote the law to provide flexibility to college students receiving work-study funds during natural disasters such as the recent fires in Southern California.   In addition, she made work-study funds available to college students who work to educate the community in civic education and disaster preparedness.  Susan is focusing on teacher quality because nothing is more important to a child's schooling than an inspiring teacher.Susan serves as Ranking Member of the Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee where her priorities for the Subcommittee are increasing access to a college degree, equal opportunity in education and the workplace, student safety, and emphasizing career and technical training - especially for women.Susan has long promoted the virtues of positive role models and passed legislation promoting youth mentoring.  In the early 90's, she was the Executive Director of the Aaron Price Fellows program designed to teach multi-ethnic high school students leadership and citizenship skills.  She has mentored many young people instilling in them a sense of community involvement and participation.National Defense and Military Families - Representing San Diego, with its large military presence, Susan has been a strong advocate for military families.  She also draws on her experience living overseas as her husband served in Japan in the Air Force during the final years of the Vietnam War.  As a past Chairwoman and Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel, she has been at the forefront on issues that directly impact service members and their families, such as increases in pay and benefits, improved housing and a health care system worthy of their service and sacrifice.When Susan learned from a constituent that some service members are blocked from having the Supreme Court review their legal cases within the military justice system, she introduced legislation to correct this injustice.  The Equal Justice for Our Military Act will give all service members access to the Supreme Court.  Our nation's men and women in uniform should not be denied access to the very judicial system they fight to protect.  In 2010, National Military Family Association recognized Susan for her work with military families and military spouses.Veterans - Susan's father served as a medic in World War II.  In addition to these experiences and San Diego's large veteran population, Susan is keenly aware of the needs and concerns of our nation's veterans.  She had the honor to serve on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs for three years.  She still influences veterans policy on the all the committees she serves.  She wrote the laws that increased home loan limit guarantees for veterans, included veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the Cal-Vet home loan program, and expanded education benefits.  She has also been a consistent supporter for increasing health care funding and overall benefits for veterans.Health Care - Susan has worked to build on the foundation of her success in giving California women direct access to their OB/GYN.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, contained many provisions championed by Susan - direct access to an OB/GYN, preserving access to crucial maternal health care for low-income women by ensuring Medicaid birth center facility fee payments, and making resources available a community-based approach to preventing new cases of type 2 Diabetes.  As a former medical social worker, Susan recognizes the need for accessible and affordable quality health care. From her position on the Education and Workforce Committee, she will be continue to work with her colleagues in finding ways to lower health care costs.In Congress, Susan is a leader an the effort to include billions of dollars of new funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to promote research, innovation and discovery to find new ways to fight and cure diseases such as AIDS and cancer."

After college, Ann went to work in the private sector and held management positions at Hallmark Cards in Kansas City and Ralston Purina in St. Louis. Ann's most important job, however, has always been as a wife and mother. Ann and Ray have three children- Raymond, a West Point graduate and U.S. Army Ranger, currently serving in the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia; Stephen, a Client Services Manager for a St. Louis area financial management company; and Mary Ruth, a recent graduate of Miami University in Ohio.Ann's public service began at the grassroots level, serving for nine years as a local committeewoman in Lafayette Township before moving on to Chair the Missouri Republican Party.  She also served as Co-Chairman of the Republican National Committee during the first term of President George W. Bush.In 2005, following a nomination by President Bush and confirmation by the U.S. Senate, Ann was sworn in as the 19th U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. She served as U.S. Ambassador for four years before returning to her home in Ballwin, Missouri.In 2010, Ann was asked to serve as the Chairman of Roy Blunt's successful U.S. Senate campaign in Missouri. Bringing her high energy and political skills to the campaign, Ann helped unite existing and new conservative grassroots activists to produce a landslide victory. Ann announced her first run for public office on April 26, 2011, and won the election for Missouri's Second Congressional District on November 6, 2012.   As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, Ann has authored legislation to protect access to affordable investments for middle class families, which passed the House twice with bipartisan support.

She sits on the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee and the Asia and Pacific Subcommittee.Throughout her tenure on Congress, Ann has made combating sex trafficking and online exploitation of minors a legislative priority.  In fact, she authored the Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation or SAVE Act, which amends the Federal criminal code, and gives prosecutors the tools they need to investigate and prosecute those who knowingly advertise sex slavery.  In May 2015, as part of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (S. 178), the SAVE Act was signed into law by President Obama."

As the only Florida Republican on the Committee, Gus continues to be a strong voice for Florida, and his roles on the Health, Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection, and Communications and Technology Subcommittees are highly beneficial for our state. With the fourth largest GDP, Florida is an important and robust economic engine that should carry great consideration when Congress examines ways we can drive this economy forward. Our state also has the greatest proportion of residents 65 years and older, making it even more important for Congress to ensure a quality and affordable healthcare system for current and future generations. Finally, with the highest per capita residential electricity demand, Florida has a vested interest in ensuring our country becomes more energy independent and has reliable access to a broad array of energy sources.Gus is also known for his work on behalf of Veterans.

Eshoo exemplifies innovation. She's creative, boundary breaking and productive. She is a problem solver and a consensus builder. In Rep. Eshoo's two decades in Congress, she has defended consumers, promoted American competitiveness and innovation, fought for access to health care for families and children, protected the environment, and encouraged development of clean energy technology.Rep. Eshoo's work consistently earns the highest approval from a wide range of organizations, including the League of Conservation Voters, the Humane Society, the American Association of University Women, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and the Science Coalition. The San Jose Mercury News named her one of the ten most powerful women in Silicon Valley ""because she sits on committees that oversee the Internet and biotech-areas vital to the valley's interests""Underlying Rep. Eshoo's tenacity to serve her constituents are her achievements. Following the tragic losses on 9/11, Rep. Eshoo recognized critical gaps in our nation's public safety communications network. As Ranking Member of the powerful House Communications and Technology Subcommittee, Eshoo was uniquely positioned to address this issue. Working from recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission Report, Eshoo led a charge in the House to create America's first nationwide, interoperable public safety communications network and to appropriate significant funding for Next Generation 9-1-1 technology. In February 2012, Congress passed legislation to do just that. The nation's first responders from local to federal levels will soon have the critical interoperable airwaves needed to effectively communicate in the event of an emergency.In the wake of the nation's housing crisis which put extraordinary strain on the California housing market, Rep. Eshoo broke new ground for homeowners. Families in her district were struggling to keep up with their mortgages, forcing many to give up their dream of owning a home. Eshoo created consensus around inclusion of a ""Homeowner Bill of Rights"" in the 50-State Settlement-a $25 billion settlement for mortgage servicing abuses perpetrated by the largest servicers. Eshoo's new borrower safeguards put an end to ""dual tracking"" a practice in which borrowers are foreclosed upon even as they negotiate the terms of a modification. The new rules also guarantee a single point of contact for borrowers seeking information about their loans. The American dream of owning one's home was severely threatened, and Rep. Eshoo took up the cause of defending it.As the Bay Area population continues to grow from booming economic growth, significant strain has been placed on the region's transportation networks, especially Caltrain. In 2012, Caltrain reached record ridership levels with 50,000 riders every week day. Rep. Eshoo has long advocated for a modernized Caltrain to meet growing demands. She knows that a 21st century Caltrain will support economic growth, create jobs and help the environment. Earlier this year, the California state legislature approved funding to modernize Caltrain. The plan is part of a $1.5 billion funding agreement to electrify the rail line, increasing safety and energy efficiency, as well as stabilize the agency's operating budget. This was an historic moment born out of Rep. Eshoo's vision of a lasting future for the spine of the Peninsula's transportation system.No matter the call, Rep. Eshoo has always answered.Rep. Eshoo was born in New Britain, Connecticut, of Assyrian and Armenian heritage. She is the proud mother of two children, Karen and Paul.Eshoo is a graduate of Canada College and the CORO Foundation. She was awarded an Honorary Degree by Menlo College and was elected to the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors in 1982. She served on the County Board for ten years before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992."

With six children to feed, times were often hard in the Pearce household, but his upbringing has made it easy for Steve to relate to the hardworking people of southern New Mexico.Steve attended New Mexico public schools his entire life, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from New Mexico State University and an MBA  from Eastern New Mexico University.  During the Vietnam War, Steve served as a combat pilot, flying over 518 hours of combat flight and 77 hours of combat support.  He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and two Air Medals, as well as seven other military medals and four exceptional service awards.  Steve continued service at Blytheville Air Force Base in Arkansas, and attained the rank of Captain.In addition to his firsthand knowledge of the military and its importance to America, Steve is a respected small-businessman who thoroughly understands the economic issues facing our country.  He and his wife Cynthia long owned and operated Lea Fishing Tools, an oilfield services company in Hobbs.  Because of this role, Steve is well aware of the regulations and taxes that plague small-business owners, and wants to help get government out of the way of these hard-working Americans.  Having built his business from the ground up, Steve created 50 jobs in his community.  He is confident that small businesses throughout southern New Mexico form the backbone for job creation and economic growth.In 1996, Steve was elected to the New Mexico House of Representatives, where he served until 2000.

With the retirement of Senator Pete Domenici, many New Mexicans were concerned about the loss of a strong conservative voice representing New Mexico in the Senate.  Steve again answered the call to serve by leaving the House and running for U.S. Senate.  His bid was ultimately unsuccessful, but in 2009, amidst an economic crisis, the passage of the President's healthcare bill, and expansion of government regulation, Steve decided to again run for Congress.  As he explained to friends and family, he made the tough decision because he was afraid for his country, and wanted to keep fighting for New Mexico.Today, Steve continues a lifetime of service as New Mexico's only conservative voice in Washington.  Steve was appointed by his peers to serve on the House Committee on Financial Services, and as chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus.

Ryan's committee assignment for the 115th Congress reflects the strengths and interests of the Sixth District's residents, and Ryan's interest in innovation, clean energy, job growth, and providing forward-looking solutions for the people he represents.Ryan is a life-long resident of Chester County, where he lives with his wife, Christine, their son, Ryan Jr, and their daughter, Caroline.  A graduate of Owen J. Roberts High School in Pottstown, Ryan earned his undergraduate degree from Ursinus College in Collegeville and his J.D. from the Villanova University School of Law.Since arriving to Congress in January 2015, Ryan has made an immediate impact in several areas, including returning control over education policy to parents and teachers, rolling back job-killing taxes on Pennsylvania's life sciences innovators, and fighting for Pennsylvania workers and families to maintain quality health coverage.  In addition, in his first year in office, Ryan re-established the House Land Conservation Caucus to promote the preservation and protection of our country's scenic open spaces and supported efforts to extend and make permanent the conservation easement tax incentive.During his first term, Ryan served on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, where he was a tireless advocate for our nation's veterans and their families. Although he no longer serves on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Ryan remains committed to helping veterans access the medical care, education benefits, and other services they've earned. In fact, Ryan introduced H.R. 27, the Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act, which was the first bill to pass the House in the 115th Congress.  Last Congress, Ryan introduced H.R. 3936, the VET Act, to create a more veteran-friendly process for filing claims and receiving assistance. The VET Act passed the House unanimously on June 21, 2016. The son of two Pennsylvania public school teachers, Ryan also places a high value on giving local educators the support and flexibility needed to prepare all students for a lifetime of success.  From the day he took office, he has worked to reduce the power of Washington bureaucrats in our classrooms and roll back one-size-fits-all standardized-testing mandates.  He was instrumental in the enactment of the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which overhauled the flawed No Child Left Behind Act, eliminated duplicative and costly standardized testing requirements, and restored decision-making over curriculum and instruction to parents, teachers, and administrators.  As a member of the Congressional Career and Technical Education Caucus and the Republican Co-Chair of the 21st Century Skills Caucus, Ryan is committed to working across the aisle to find commonsense solutions to ensure our students have the financial aid and in-demand skills needed to achieve successful careers in the modern job market. That's why he introduced H.R. 5663, the Critical Thinking, Collaboration, Communication, and Creativity (4 C's) for Careers Act, legislation that would align education programs with state and local workforce development efforts so students are learning the skills employers need. This legislation also encourages curriculum planning to emphasize the development of employability skills and attaining credentials. Through these initiatives, students in Southeastern Pennsylvania would be more prepared for today's competitive workforce.Another priority of Ryan's is building a safe and reliable transportation network that can create jobs and protect economic opportunity. During his first term, Ryan helped enact a fully-paid, five-year transportation funding package that will bring more than $770 million back to Pennsylvania for bridges, roads, and passenger and freight rail improvements.  This effort, also known as the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, streamlined the project-approval process and included a provision Ryan authored to allow short-line railroads to compete for federal grants to improve safety at road crossings.Renowned national political commentator Stuart Rothenberg described Ryan as ""a pragmatic conservative"" while Reading Eagle columnist Ron Southwick noted Ryan's enthusiasm for the job, predicting that he would be engaged and not simply ""an anonymous lawmaker who merely keeps a seat warm.""Prior to winning election to Congress in 2014, Ryan served the residents of Chester County on the Board of Commissioners.  He was selected chairman of the Board of Commissioners in 2013.  While still in law school, Ryan won a seat on the East Vincent Township Board of Supervisors, serving as Chairman for four years."

Prior to being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, Congressman Duncan served as branch manager and an Assistant Vice President during his seven years of working in community banking. Later, he became the President and CEO of J. Duncan Associates, a South Carolina based, family owned real estate marketing firm which specialized in statewide real estate auctions.Duncan served as a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives from 2002-2010, where he served as the Chairman of the House Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environmental Affairs Committee from 2007 to 2009.During his tenure in the South Carolina House of Representatives, Jeff was known as one of the most conservative House Members, earning recognition as a ""Taxpayer's Hero"" from Governor Mark Sanford for his work combating wasteful government spending and fighting against tax increases. Jeff has also received the ""Guardian of Small Business"" award from the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB); he had an A+ rating from the Club for Growth; he was awarded the Palmetto Leadership Award from the SC Policy Council during his Freshman term; ""Legislator of the Year"" recognition from both the SC Recreation and Parks Association and the SC Wildlife Federation.  In 2010, Jeff Duncan was awarded The Order of the Palmetto, the highest civilian honor awarded by the Governor of South Carolina.Congressman Duncan is passionate about American Energy Independence.  While a State Legislator, Jeff served on the US Department of the Interior's Outer Continental Shelf's 5 year Planning Sub-Committee which was charged with making recommendations for oil and natural gas leases on offshore areas. In addition, he served on the state's Natural Gas Offshore Drilling Study Committee and was appointed to represent the state of South Carolina on the Southern States Energy Board.Elected in 2010 to the 112th Congress, Jeff currently sits on House committees including the Homeland Security Committee, and the Foreign Affairs Committee.  He also serves as the Subcommittee Chairman of Foreign Affairs' Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. Additionally, Congressman Duncan was appointed by Speaker John Boehner to the Executive Committee for the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission.Jeff takes a particular interest in the promotion of nuclear energy, a topic especially important to South Carolina, home of the Savannah River Site nuclear complex.  Energy independence is vital to national security and a segue to job creation.  Congressman Duncan views nuclear power as a key ingredient in that equation. He supports the use of the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada as a long-term storage site for nuclear waste.  Although he is a strong proponent of American solutions to American energy issues, Congressman Duncan is not in favor of federal energy subsidies for alternative energy or ethanol.A member of both the Republican Study Committee and the Tea Party Caucus, Jeff took a strong stand on major fiscal issues in the 112th Congress. Dissatisfied with the level of spending cuts offered, he split from a majority of Republicans in his opposition of- the final fiscal 2011 spending deal; the final debt limit increase deal in August 2011; both versions of a bill to keep the government operating at the start of fiscal 2012; and the final FY 2012 Appropriations bill.  A strong believer in the Constitution, Jeff fought against ambiguous language in the National Defense Authorization Act which he feels could put certain American liberties in peril.In February 2011, he introduced a resolution that would create a new committee called the Committee on the Elimination of Nonessential Federal Programs, with the express purpose of reducing federal outlays. He supports taking a closer look at any government agency that is not included in the constitutional role of the federal government.Jeff strongly believes that border security does fit the Constitutional definition of a federal duty and is proudly a member of the Border and Maritime Security subcommittee. He advocates an ""all-of-the-above"" strategy for border enforcement, including physical fencing, greater use of surveillance technology and increased manpower. His stance on border security includes an immigration policy aspect, as well as a national security element. He supports stronger enforcement of immigration laws and opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants already in the country.Duncan has also worked the national security angle to border enforcement from his position on the Foreign Affairs Committee. When news reports broke in October 2011 that the Iranian government allegedly wanted members of Mexican drug cartels to carry out an assassination on U.S. soil, Duncan introduced a resolution urging the government to consider Iran a threat to the Western Hemisphere when formulating counterterrorism strategy.Act! for America presented Representative Duncan with the ""2011 National Security Patriot Award"" because of his strong and enduring commitment to protecting our national security and democratic values.Jeff also serves as the co-chairman of the Sovereignty Caucus. The Caucus seeks to combat the influence of international organizations and multilateral agreements on United States policy. He urges greater scrutiny of foreign aid and has been an advocate for blocking economic assistance to governments that oppose the United States in the U.N. General Assembly.In September 2011, Duncan became the only member of Congress with a 100 percent rating on the Heritage Action for America legislative scorecard ""covering the full spectrum of conservatism."" Jeff has been married to his wife Melody for twenty-seven years and they have three sons- Graham, John Philip, and Parker. The Duncan family are members of First Baptist Church of Clinton, South Carolina."

She was one of their first female sales associates and one of their first female sales managers, assisting the company in establishing a division focused on women. Marsha moved to the corporate world as Director of Retail Fashion and Special Events for the Castner Knott Company. She later founded Marketing Strategies, focused on the retail marketplace and expanded her work to electronic and print media with consumer segments and articles.Congressman Blackburn began her elected service career in 1998 as a Tennessee State Senator. Blackburn's Senate career was marked by her commitment to fiscal common sense and government accountability. She became known to Tennesseans for holding ""Budget Schools"" both in her district and across the state; identifying waste, proposing realistic spending cuts, and offering solutions for a state in a budget crunch.While serving in the Tennessee Senate, Blackburn led a statewide grassroots campaign to defeat a proposed state income tax. While defeating the tax, she earned the reputation as a champion of anti-tax and government accountability issues, taking to the airwaves to make the case that government wrongly believes it never gets enough of the taxpayer's paycheck. She earned the attention of publications like the Wall Street Journal and groups such as Americans for Tax Reform. In November 2014, the people of Tennessee passed an amendment to the state constitution to 'expressly prohibit a state income tax' - what a fitting cap to a 14 year battle.

I have voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act over 50 times.

At the beginning of the 114th Congress, over ninety percent of both chambers of Congress supported the formula's repeal and it was signed into law. As one of the largest entitlement reforms in the past few decades, this landmark policy will ensure greater access and quality for seniors, more stable reimbursements for providers, and a more fiscally solvent Medicare system as a whole. As a member of Congress representing one of the fastest-growing areas of the country, transportation is also a top priority.

Another move shortly thereafter landed Claire in Columbia, Missouri, where she attended Hickman High School.A product of Missouri's public schools, Claire began waiting tables in the Lake of the Ozarks the day after graduating high school - a job she would hold for six years in order to help pay her way through college and law school at the University of Missouri - Columbia.After law school, Claire started work as an assistant prosecutor in Kansas City. She eventually served as a felony courtroom prosecutor specializing in sex crimes and arson cases.In 1982, Claire won a seat in the Missouri State Legislature, where she chaired the General Assembly's Civil and Criminal Justice Committee, helping shape the state's criminal justice system to better protect Missouri's families and improve safety in their communities.Claire made history in 1992 when she became the first woman to be elected Jackson County Prosecutor. As head of the largest prosecutor's office in the state, in a region that includes Kansas City, Claire broke new ground in combatting violent crime. She launched one of the nation's first drug courts, and established a domestic violence unit - a first-of-its-kind initiative for the region, aimed at curbing domestic and sex violence, as well as child abuse.Claire won reelection and served as Jackson County Prosecutor until 1999, when she was sworn in as Missouri State Auditor.As the state's top government watchdog, Claire revolutionized the office of State Auditor - expanding her work beyond traditional financial audits, to include ""performance audits"" to root out fraud and abuse of power in state agencies and organizations.Claire's dogged pursuit of accountability included audits of the state's Social Services Foster Care Program and child support enforcement, Child Abuse Hotline, child care facilities inspections and licensing, as well as domestic violence shelters and puppy mills.She also conducted reviews of the effectiveness of Missouri's Sunshine Law, education funding, and the rise in student loan and college tuition rates in the state.In 2004, Claire took on her own party establishment and became the only person in Missouri history to defeat a sitting Governor in a primary election.In 2006, Claire became the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Missouri.Making good on a campaign pledge, Claire waged a successful six-year effort to rein in wasteful wartime contracting practices in Iraq and Afghanistan. During the final hours of Claire's first Senate term, her signature legislation implementing historic wartime contracting reforms was signed into law.Claire's efforts led to the creation of a new Senate panel charged with financial and contracting oversight. As Chairman, Claire led nearly 40 hearings, and launched an even greater number of investigations at dozens of federal departments and agencies, resulting in more than 30 instances of misconduct referred to federal investigators.Claire drew on her personal commitment to America's military veterans, helping to pass the 21st Century GI Bill, and establishing a veterans' ""secret shopper"" program to improve health care services for Missouri's veterans.

Too many North Carolinians are struggling to make ends meet. That is why Congressman Butterfield is working to expand opportunity to all Americans and ensure the poor and middle class have a seat at the decision making table. From the courts to Congress, G. K. Butterfield has always fought for equality of opportunity.    Congressman Butterfield's roots in Wilson, N.C. taught him the values of hard work and responsibility. His father, Dr. G. K. Butterfield Sr., was a respected dentist and elected official.   Many of his patients had never received dental services because they were unable to afford care. However, Dr. Butterfield did not turn anyone away because they were unable to pay. To him, access to care was a right for everyone, not a privilege for the few.Congressman Butterfield's mother, Addie, was passionate about education. She taught elementary school for 48 years in some of the poorest communities in North Carolina. Mrs. Butterfield was keenly focused on making sure her students learned to read--a right that was denied to many Blacks in the South. Congressman Butterfield's parents led by example and instilled in him the importance of serving your community and working to give people the opportunity to succeed. After graduating from Charles H.

For 14 years, Butterfield practiced law across eastern North Carolina representing mostly low-income clients who needed legal services. He also focused on protecting civil rights, winning several voting rights cases that earned him the reputation of a principled litigator. Butterfield's litigation work helped to preserve the ability of several African American communities to elect candidates of their choice to public office.Congressman Butterfield was elected Resident Superior Court Judge for the First Judicial Division. For 13 years, he presided over civil and criminal courts in 46 counties throughout North Carolina.In February 2001, then-Governor Mike Easley appointed Butterfield to the North Carolina Supreme Court. While serving on the highest court in the state, Congressman Butterfield authored more than 15 opinions on cases involving judicial sentencing procedures, eminent domain, and the application of capital punishment.In 2004, G. K. Butterfield retired from the bench to run in a special election to fill the unexpired term of Congressman Frank Ballance (NC-01). Congressman Butterfield won a crowded primary election to fill the seat, where he captured 71 percent of the vote.In January 2007, Congressman Butterfield was appointed a Chief Deputy Whip of the House Democratic Caucus, a position in which he continues to serve.

As member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, in 2010, Castor requested a report on BP's enormous advertising budget in the wake of the blowout and questioned the oil company's actions to spend more money ""polishing its corporate image"" than on helping Gulf Coast states recover from the April 2010 disaster.Castor introduced the Gulf of Mexico Economic and Environmental Restoration Act to fund long-term economic recovery, environmental restoration and research with the fines and penalties to be paid by BP for its pollution under the Clean Water Act. Extensive bipartisan efforts continued on this legislation in 2011, and in June 2012, Gulf Coast states and the Gulf of Mexico achieved a major victory when the RESTORE Act was passed by Congress. Before her election to Congress, Castor served as a Hillsborough County Commissioner and chair of the Hillsborough County Environmental Protection Commission. As County Commissioner in 2005, she was the sole vote against a gay pride ban; this ban was finally repealed unanimously by the Hillsborough County Commission in 2013. In 2005, Castor was named as the Tampa Bay Business Journal's Woman of the Year in government.Castor is a graduate of Tampa's Chamberlain High School, Emory University and Florida State University College of Law. Castor and her husband have two daughters. She is the daughter of former Hillsborough County Judge Don Castor and former University of South Florida President and statewide-elected Education Commissioner Betty Castor.

The hard-working middle class could get ahead, and government was there to help ensure that there was opportunity for all who were willing to work hard and play by the rules.Sinema knows firsthand the struggles families face. As someone whose family at times faced serious poverty growing up, she knows what it means to struggle just to meet the most basic needs. For three years, her family lived in an old gas station - a rectangle building with no electricity or running water.Luckily, her hard work in school paid off with a full-ride scholarship to college. She also saved money by earning over 60 college course credits at community college while attending high school.After college, Sinema became a social worker helping struggling families. She soon realized that the problems they came to her with - poverty, homelessness, job loss, abuse - were common to so many families, and that solving these problems meant thinking bigger than one family at a time. It required fighting for real change to rebuild an America that works for ALL Americans.So Sinema went back to school and started working at the grassroots level to help people access our leaders and talk about their needs. She helped them argue for better schools and fought to ensure that the services we fund were actually helping the people who need and deserve them. Her feeling was that if she could help these struggling people change the circumstances in which they live, instead of just giving them a food box and trying to help them find a place to sleep for a night, that she had done her job. Because she believes that everyone should get the same shot and that the system should not favor those at the very top, she ran for the legislature and won.There she worked to pass tough immigration laws, securing funding for our vets, working to provide business incentives for job creation and fighting back against attempts to gut basic health care for kids, cuts to services for the elderly and dramatic drops to school funding.Sinema brings passion and knowledge to the causes she fights for - and a unique ability to win. In 2011, Kyrsten was lauded by the Arizona Republic for her ""remarkable"" ability to ""partner with Republicans in both the House and Senate"" to pass legislation while remaining ""a staunch defender of key Democratic priorities.""Sinema is committed to helping our country return to the values that make America great-the same values that have guided her life so far- hard work, access to public education, fairness and opportunity.  Sinema takes her passion and talent into the 114th Congress, serving Arizona's Ninth Congressional District.  She has been to appointed to House Committee on Financial Services.  "

At the age of eight, my family and I were forced to flee from the oppressive communist regime of Fidel Castro. We settled in Miami and put down permanent roots in our community. I attended Southside Elementary School in Little Havana, West Miami Junior High, and Southwest High School. In the years following, I earned an Associate of Arts degree from Miami-Dade Community College in 1972, Bachelors and Masters Degree in Education from Florida International University in 1975 and 1985 respectively, and a Doctorate in Education from the University of Miami in 2004. I consider education a lifelong journey.I began my career as a Florida certified teacher. I also founded and served as the principal and teacher of a private bilingual elementary school in Hialeah. I was inspired to enter public service by many of the parents and students; to fight on their behalf for a stronger educational system, lower taxes, and a brighter economic future.In 1982, I was elected to the Florida State House of Representatives and the Florida Senate in 1986, becoming the first Hispanic woman to serve in either body. In the state legislature, I sponsored the legislation for the Florida Pre Paid College Program, which is now the largest pre-paid college tuition program in the nation. More than one million Florida families have used this program to send their children to college.I was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1989-- the first Hispanic woman to serve in Congress--following a special election to fill the seat held by the late Claude Pepper. I have been strongly returned to Congress since.I remain committed to improving the lives of my constituents and our beautiful South Florida community. As the economy remains a pressing issue for so many of South Florida's families, I support reducing taxes and cutting unnecessary government spending. I also support plans to balance the federal budget and increase tax incentives for small businesses and middle class families. Given my background in education, I have worked to strengthen the Head Start program. I have also supported legislation to increase the availability to student financial aid and revise the cumbersome and complicated Federal Application for Student Aid (FAFSA) process.I am a strong advocate of programs that address the serious problem of domestic violence against women. I was a lead sponsor of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which increases resources towards the prosecution of domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault. I also support legislation to increase criminal penalties for perpetrators of Medicare fraud. Medicare fraud is a deplorable practice which robs hardworking seniors of the benefits they spent a lifetime earning, while also wasting billions in taxpayer dollars.As the wife of a Vietnam veteran and step-mother to Marine aviators, I am passionate about improving our nation's military, safeguarding veteran's health care, and ensuring that returning veterans have access to a college education. I also authored legislation awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). These women pioneers had been denied recognition for their service during World War II.I am Chairman emeritus of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and am now Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. In this role, I continue to voice my strong support for the state of Israel and human rights, including my opposition to Castro's dictatorial regime in Cuba. I have also led on pressing foreign policy issues including the fight against Islamist extremism, and support of free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. I was proud to lead the fight in the House of Representatives to impose sanctions on human rights violators in Venezuela. I also proudly serve on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to help ensure our nation has the best intelligence gathering capabilities and processes to determine actionable threats.I am the proud wife to Dexter Lehtinen, mother and step-mother to 4 adult children, and grandmother to four beautiful grandchildren - Morgan Elizabeth, Caroline Grace, Killian Marie, and Dustin Winslow."

He had the rare distinction of being both a star athlete and a mathlete. In high school, Tom was known to love football, algebra and his mohawk haircut.Tom entered the work force at an early age, flipping burgers and delivering pizza to start. At age 17, Tom started his first business, Tough Turf Land Sculpting, and he hired his first employee. He continued to work and pay his way through college, graduating from the University of Georgia with a degree in finance.After college, Tom worked as an asset recovery specialist for a department store chain, but his entrepreneurial spirit remained. He saved enough to buy a landscaping business and eventually became a real estate investor.In his spare time, Tom was seen riding around on his motorcycle with future wife Julie on board. It was on that motorcycle that they left their wedding ceremony and, some days later, saw a ""for sale"" sign by a winding dirt road in Gordon County. They ventured down the road and, after some rewiring and plumbing, they called that small farm house in Ranger their home.It wasn't until his thirties that Tom thought about running for public office. News came that an abortion clinic was planning to open nearby. Tom supported Julie as she became the founder and president of a peaceful, pro-life organization that opposed the plans. The community spoke and the clinic never opened. Inspired by their success, Tom discovered the power to do good through public action and ran for the Georgia General Assembly. He served there for over seven years.In the state legislature, Tom used his work experience to craft legislation, such as the Georgia Jobs Act, that would grow the economy and create new job opportunities. He understood the simple fact that when a business pays less in taxes it has more money to hire people. Tom also gained a reputation for taking on excessive government after working on a zero-based budgeting bill that made state agencies justify every taxpayer dollar they wanted to spend, every year.In 2010, the congressional seat for Georgia's 9th district opened. Still dreaming big, Tom decided to run as a ""pro-life, pro-gun, tax-cutting constitutional conservative."" He had to win four elections in 91 days and was sworn in that summer as a U.S. congressman from Georgia. As a result of redistricting, Tom was reelected in 2012 to represent the new 14th Congressional District.In Congress, Tom serves on the House Appropriations Committee, which determines how the United States government spends taxpayer dollars. This assignment means Tom is on the front lines of the battle to solve America's debt crisis. He works to balance the budget, cut government waste, and reform Congress so that it that focuses on saving - not spending - taxpayer dollars.Back home in Ranger, Tom's three kids - JoAnn, John and Janey - keep him busy, often teaching him the nuances of the latest social network. Julie's heart for children has never changed, and she currently teaches at Red Bud Elementary. In the early mornings, Tom can be found running mountain trails or riding his bike through the hills of Georgia in preparation for the next triathlon.At home he's ""Dad"" at Rock Bridge Community Church in Calhoun they just call him Tom, and around Georgia he's one of the neighbors attending gun shows and cattle auctions. Tom is still dreaming big, working hard and seeking to achieve much for those he represents in the 14th Congressional District."

Rep. Love recalls both her parents working hard to earn a living.   Her father, at times, worked more than one job to pay school tuition for his three children.  On the day of Love's college orientation, her father said something to her that would become the mantra for her life-""Mia, your mother and I never took a handout. You will not be a burden to society. You will give back.""Rep. Love graduated from the University of Hartford with a degree in fine arts. She moved to Utah and married her husband, Jason Love.  She was eager to carry forward her father's ethic of 'giving back'.  Rep. Love served two terms on the city council of Saratoga Springs, one of Utah's fastest growing cities. As City Councilwoman and eventually Mayor, she led the city through a period of 1700% population growth in a decade. Under her leadership, the city was able to successfully navigate the drastic transition from agricultural fields to a booming residential community. When the citizen growth necessitated fire and police services, Love fought to make sure the city's first ever residential tax implementation would only pay for those essential services, and she structured it in such a way that the tax decreased as a percentage of property value.Rep. Love is best known for her conservative positions on limited government, increased citizen liberties and limited restraints on business. She believes the best thing she can do as a Congresswoman is to urge the federal government to stay out of the way of business and out of the lives of citizens. She advocates a return to personal responsibility and reduced government dependency, again a value engendered by her father.She felt so deeply about these convictions, she ran for Congress in 2012, and again in 2014 where she was victorious.  Now in her second term in Congress, Representative Love has been very busy keeping the promises she made to her constituents in the 4th district by voting to foster local control in all aspects of government.Congresswoman Love has sponsored a variety of bills, 10 in her first term, one of which passed the House of Representatives in April, 2016.  (H.R. 3791 would give more small banks the flexibility to lend money to consumers.)   She is the co-sponsor of dozens of additional bills, including legislation that promotes local control of education, free market solutions to our healthcare crisis, and cutting the regulatory burden that the federal government has imposed on small businesses.Rep. Love is serving on the Financial Services committee, and on the Monetary Policy and Trade, Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, and the Terrorism and Illicit Financing subcommittees.   In 2016, Rep. Love is also served on the Select Investigative Committee on Infant Lives.    Based on her votes, she has twice been honored to accept the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 'Spirit of Enterprise Award', the American Conservative Union's 'Award for Conservative Excellence', the IFDA's 'Thomas Jefferson Award, the Susan B. Anthony List's 'Marilyn Musgrave Defender of Life' award, and the National Federation of Independent Business 'Small Business Guardian Award' ."

She serves on two committees- the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.Before her congressional service, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to serve as the first woman to chair the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She came to Congress as a national figure who had been a civil rights and feminist leader, tenured professor of law, and board member at three Fortune 500 companies. Congresswoman Norton has been named one of the 100 most important American women in one survey and one of the most powerful women in Washington in another. The Congresswoman's work for full congressional voting representation and for full democracy for the people of the District of Columbia continues her lifelong struggle for universal human and civil rights.Congresswoman Norton's accomplishments in breaking barriers for her disempowered district are matched by her success in bringing home unique economic benefits to her constituents. Among them are senatorial courtesy to recommend federal judges, the U.S. Attorney, and other significant federal law enforcement positions for the District; up to $10,000 per year for all D.C. high school graduates to attend any public U.S. college or university and up to $2,500 per year to many private colleges and universities; a unique $5,000 D.C. homebuyer tax credit, which has sharply increased home ownership in the District and was a major factor in stabilizing the city's population; and D.C. business tax incentives, including a significant wage credit for employing D.C. residents, which has maintained businesses and residents in the District.Congresswoman Norton also has brought significant economic development to the District of Columbia throughout her service in Congress, creating and preserving jobs in D.C. The most significant are her work in bringing to D.C. the U.S. Department of Homeland Security headquarters compound, now under construction, and is the largest federal construction project in the country; her bill that is developing the 55 acre-Southeast Federal Center, the first private development on federal land; her work that resulted in the relocation of 6,000 jobs to the Washington Navy Yard; and her successful efforts to bring to the District the new headquarters for the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, along with an additional Metro station at New York Avenue, which has resulted in the development of the NOMA neighborhood.Congresswoman Norton helped end the city's most serious financial crisis in a century, in the 1990's,by achieving a historic package that for the first time restructured the financial relationship between Congress and the District, by transferring $5 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and billions more in state costs to the federal government.The Congresswoman, who taught law full time before being elected, is a tenured professor of law at Georgetown University, teaching an upper-class seminar there every year. After receiving her bachelor's degree from Antioch College in Ohio, she simultaneously earned her law degree and a master's degree in American Studies from Yale University.

During his term as Chairman of the Polk County Republican Executive Committee, the party elected many local Republican officials and developed a successful organization that helped spread strong principles of individual freedoms, personal responsibility, less government, and lower taxes.In 1996, Dennis ran unsuccessfully for the State Senate, losing to a very well-liked incumbent, Senator Rick Dantzler. However, the race taught him many things about the political process and about being true to one's self and community. In 2000, Dennis had an opportunity to run for the State House of Representatives and was elected by an overwhelming majority. Dennis continued to serve in the Florida House of Representatives until he was term limited in 2008. Throughout his term as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, Dennis distinguished himself as a strong proponent of conservative principles and was well respected by members of both parties. In 2007, Dennis, along with Rep. Don Brown, were the only two legislators to vote against the property insurance bill that made Citizens the largest property insurer in Florida. For voting against his party and with his free market principles, Dennis was stripped of his Chairmanship and many said his career was over. But Dennis is a conservative leader, not only of independent thought but of independent action as well. In 2010, Dennis was elected to the United States House of Representatives running on those same principles. He was then selected as Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform (OGR) Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, U.S. Postal Service, and Labor Policy, making him one of the few first-term lawmakers to serve as a chairman of a subcommittee. He is currently a member of the OGR Subcommittees on the Interior, Energy, and Environment and Government Operations. At the beginning of the 113th Congress, Dennis was selected to serve on the prestigious Financial Services Committee (FSC), another selection that does not happen often to newer members. Within the FSC, Dennis serves as Vice Chair of the Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance, and as a member on the Subcommittees on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit and Oversight and Investigations. Finally, during the summer of 2014, Dennis was selected as a Senior Deputy Majority Whip under Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a leadership position that allows him to better serve his Florida constituents as a conservative voice at the leadership table. Dennis and Cindy have two children, Shane and Travis. The family enjoys traveling throughout the United States. They have been to each of the 48 continental states, predominantly by motor home and with their several family dogs. The family shares a passion for American history, national parks, and the great outdoors. Dennis is an avid hunter and so are his sons who enjoy not only hunting, but also fishing and camping. They are members of the First Presbyterian Church in Lakeland. Cindy serves the Lakeland community in multiple ways, including on the Habitat for Humanity Community Advisory Board, and has been Volunteer-of-the-Year at Rochelle School of the Arts and George Jenkins High School. Together the family believes that community service, regardless of how it is performed, is one of the most responsible acts a person can give to his or her fellow man."

They included- protections against identity theft, preventing fraud in public housing, protecting Medicare plans from being taken away from seniors and a bill allowing all veterans to get an official identification card.In all, 14 Buchanan initiatives have been signed into law by Presidents Trump, Obama and Bush.Serving his sixth term, Buchanan is an outspoken advocate of reforming the U.S. tax code to make it simpler and fairer.

Now serving his fifth term in the 115th Congress, he has been described as a rising voice in the House Democratic Caucus by the Washington newspaper Roll Call and was previously named one of the Forward newspaper's top Jewish politicians to watch. He is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, the House Ethics Committee, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on which he serves as Ranking Democrat on the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee.Noted by the South Florida Sun Sentinel for his accessible personality, sense of humor, and thoughtful approach to the issues, Ted has proven himself to be energetic advocate for the priorities of his constituents. His plan to strengthen Social Security and improve benefits for all retirees was highlighted by the New York Times, and his efforts to boost cancer research, fight hunger and poverty, and institute sensible criminal justice reforms has won praise from prominent organizations like the American Cancer Society, the National Committee to Preserve Medicare and Social Security, and the American Bar Association. Ted's priorities in the 114th Congress include promoting economic opportunity in South Florida, reducing the influence of big money in our elections, reforming our broken immigration system, and advancing the security interests of the United States, Israel, and our allies.As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Ted has worked to defend voting rights, protect the integrity of our elections, and promote equality under the law. In 2015, Ted earned the support of more than 120 of his colleagues for the Udall-Deutch ""Democracy for All Amendment"" which would amend the U.S. Constitution to overturn Supreme Court rulings like Citizens United and McCutcheon. In his role as a member of the House Democracy Task Force, Ted has worked alongside several national grassroots organizations committed to getting big money out of our elections, including Public Citizen, People for the American Way, Common Cause, Free Speech for People, and Communications Workers of America. In 2012, Ted played a major role in shutting down Florida Governor Rick Scott's effort to purge up to 180,000 legitimate voters from Florida's rolls by highlighting decorated war veterans, small business owners, and naturalized citizens whose voting rights were unjustly jeopardized. Ted serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where he plays a leadership role as Ranking Democrat on the influential Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Ted has been deeply engaged in Middle East issues for several years, first gaining national recognition during his time in the Florida State Senate for passing the first law in the country divesting public pension funds from Iran. Since arriving in Congress, several of Ted's legislative initiatives have earned bipartisan support, including the Iran Transparency and Accountability Act and the Iran Human Rights and Democracy Promotion Act, both of which were incorporated in to the Iran Threat Reduction Act and signed into law by the President Obama. In 2014, Ted introduced and passed the bipartisan U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership Act to enhance U.S. cooperation with Israel in areas like agriculture, energy, security, and other areas. Ted is also a passionate advocate for boosting foreign aid, promoting global health, and protecting human rights abroad. Ted has also championed issues unique to South Florida. During the 113th Congress, he passed legislation advancing the efforts of Mitch Libman, a constituent fighting to find out why his friend Private Leonard Kravitz never received the Medal of Honor for his extraordinary heroism in the Korean War. Ted's amended version of the National Defense Authorization Act enabled the White House to eventually move forward with a ceremony on March 18, 2014 in which President Obama awarded the Medal of Honor to 24 veterans whose heroism may have gone unrecognized due to prejudice against their Jewish or Hispanic heritage. In the 112th Congress, Ted advocated for thousands of homeowners in South Florida and around the country whose homes were built with contaminated Chinese drywall and worked across the aisle to pass the bipartisan Drywall Safety Act.Ted Deutch, and his wife of 24 years, Jill Deutch, have lived and worked in South Florida since 1997.

He believes that the most important way the nation can reduce the federal budget deficit and grow the economy is to get Americans back to work. He endorsed legislation to increase small business lending, extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to provide tax relief to Americans at all income levels while the economy recovers, eliminate the burdensome estate tax, and close tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas. In order to restore the nation's economic security, Congressman Bishop has supported a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment; legislation to require any new spending by Congress to be offset by spending cuts and/or enhancing revenues; caps on discretionary spending; and reforming defense procurement and weapons acquisition.Since 2003, Congressman Bishop has served on the House Committee on Appropriations.

The measure was signed into law in November 2011 (P.L. 112-56). In the 111th Congress (2009-2010), Congressman Bishop successfully fought to prevent the U.S. Department of Transportation from banning peanuts on airlines. He also helped over 700 military spouses at Fort Benning keep their career advancement tuition assistance. In addition, Congressman Bishop was instrumental in securing estate tax relief.

His dedication to the highest ethical standards and moral principles has won him the admiration of many of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the United States Congress.He has been called ""the conscience of the U.S. Congress"" and Roll Call magazine has said, ""John Lewisis a genuine American hero and moral leader who commands widespread respect in the chamber.""He was born the son of sharecroppers on February 21, 1940, outside of Troy, Alabama.  He grew up on his family's farm and attended segregated public schools in Pike County, Alabama.  As a young boy, he was inspired by the activism surrounding the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., which he heard on radio broadcasts.  In those pivotal moments, he made a decision to become a part of the Civil Rights Movement. Ever since then, he has remained at the vanguard of progressive social movements and the human rights struggle in the United States.As a student at Fisk University, John Lewis organized sit-in demonstrations at segregated lunch counters in Nashville, Tennessee.  In 1961, he volunteered to participate in the Freedom Rides, which challenged segregation at interstate bus terminals across the South. Lewis risked his life on those Rides many times by simply sitting in seats reserved for white patrons.  He was also beaten severely by angry mobs and arrested by police for challenging the injustice of Jim Crow segregation in the South.During the height of the Movement, from 1963 to 1966, Lewis was named Chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which he helped form. SNCC was largely responsible for organizing student activism in the Movement, including sit-ins and other activities.While still a young man, John Lewis became a nationally recognized leader. By 1963, he was dubbed one of the Big Six leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. At the age of 23, he was an architect of and a keynote speaker at the historic March on Washington in August 1963.In 1964, John Lewis coordinated SNCC efforts to organize voter registration drives and community action programs during the Mississippi Freedom Summer. The following year, Lewis helped spearhead one of the most seminal moments of the Civil Rights Movement.   Hosea Williams, another notable Civil Rights leader, and John Lewis led over 600 peaceful, orderly protestors across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965.  They intended to march from Selma to Montgomery to demonstrate the need for voting rights in the state.  The marchers were attacked by Alabama state troopers in a brutal confrontation that became known as ""Bloody Sunday.""   News broadcasts and photographs revealing the senseless cruelty of the segregated South helped hasten the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.Despite more than 40 arrests, physical attacks and serious injuries, John Lewis remained a devoted advocate of the philosophy of nonviolence. After leaving SNCC in 1966, he continued his commitment to the Civil Rights Movement as Associate Director of the Field Foundation and his participation in the Southern Regional Council's voter registration programs. Lewis went on to become the Director of the Voter Education Project (VEP). Under his leadership, the VEP transformed the nation's political climate by adding nearly four million minorities to the voter rolls.In 1977, John Lewis was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to direct more than 250,000 volunteers of ACTION, the federal volunteer agency.In 1981, he was elected to the Atlanta City Council. While serving on the Council, he was an advocate for ethics in government and neighborhood preservation. He was elected to Congress in November 1986 and has served as U.S. Representative of Georgia's Fifth Congressional District since then. He is Senior Chief Deputy Whip for the Democratic Party in leadership in the House, a member of the House Ways & Means Committee, a member of its Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, and Ranking Member of its Subcommittee on Oversight.John Lewis holds a B.A. in Religion and Philosophy from Fisk University, and he is a graduate of the American Baptist Theological Seminary, both in Nashville, Tennessee. He has been awarded over 50 honorary degrees from prestigious colleges and universities throughout the United States, including Harvard University, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania,  Princeton University, Duke University, Morehouse College, Clark-Atlanta University, Howard University, Brandeis University, Columbia University, Fisk University, and Troy State University.John Lewis is the recipient of numerous awards from eminent national and international institutions, including the highest civilian honor granted by President Barack Obama, the Medal of Freedom, the Lincoln Medal from the historic Ford's Theatre, the Golden Plate Award given by the Academy of Excellence, the Preservation Hero award given by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Capital Award of the National Council of La Raza,  the Martin Luther King, Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize, the President's Medal of Georgetown University, the NAACP Spingarn Medal, the National Education Association Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Award, and the only John F.

He is the only Member of the Iowa delegation, House and Senate, on the powerful Committee which is responsible for writing legislation that allocates funding to federal agencies and departments. His most important priority - to be a diligent watchdog of Iowans' hard earned tax dollars. People in Iowa and across the country are frustrated with how dysfunctional Washington has become.

Rush is a transcendent American leader who keeps his legislative and policy interests sharply focused on the needs of his constituents - especially the most vulnerable. He believes in the redemptive power of the human spirit. He believes in human ingenuity and tenacity. He knows the power of a made up mind. As a member of Congress, Rush stands on the shoulders of a long line of patriots and public servants who have gone before him and who are ardent believers in our Constitution. His life is an example of our nation's fundamental promise and his work reflects a deep determination to bend the arc of government resources and innovation towards the needs of every American. Rush is an honorably discharged veteran of the United States Army and an ordained minister with a Master's Degree in Theology. In addition to his congressional responsibilities, Rush is the pastor of the Beloved Community Christian Church of God in Christ in Chicago. He and his wife, Carolyn, have a blended family with seven children including a son who lost his life to gun violence in 1999.From his very first year in office, Rush focused on issues of importance to low- and middle-income families and communities. In 1993, as a freshman in the 103rd Congress, Rush introduced bills on issues as diverse as Conflict Resolution and Mediation to Public Pensions and Community Development.Rush's track record of leadership on energy issues and his support for small business while serving as an alderman in the Chicago City Council paved the way for him to gain a seat on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee in his second term.Rush's attention to detail inspired his peers to elect him Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection during the 111th Congress. Key pieces of legislation that Rush crafted surrounding postpartum depression, women's health (Sec. 2951 and Sec. 2952 of Subtitle L), and prescription drug offsets (Sec. 7101 and Sec. 7102 of Subtitle B) were adopted in the landmark health care legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), signed into law by President Barack Obama.Because of Rush's leadership over the years on a range of small business issues and community-based lending, Rush was chosen to serve as a conferee as part of the final, bipartisan deliberative process that led to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203). Rush fought hard to help ensure that low- and middle-income consumers would never again fall prey to the ill-conceived, predatory financial practices that led to the near epic collapse of U. S. financial markets in 2008.In 1996, Rush served as a conferee on the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104). This law, the first major overhaul of U.S. telecommunications law in almost 62 years, marked the first time the Internet was included in the broadcasting spectrum allotment and paved the way for the growth of cable and Internet accessibility throughout the nation.During his tenure, Rush has brought more than one billion dollars to the 1st Congressional District. Through his determined advocacy, he has led efforts to fund major infrastructure projects in the district such as the reconstruction of the Dan Ryan Expressway, the Lovana S. 'Lou' Jones/Bronzeville Metra Station, the CREATE Englewood Flyover, the CTA Red Line Reconstruction, and the CTA Red Line 95th Street Station Renovation. Over the years he has obtained millions of dollars in grants for libraries, museums, municipalities, police departments, hospitals, schools and programs that support the arts.Since the convening of the 112th Congress in 2011, Rush has served as the Ranking Democratic Member of the House Energy & Commerce Committee's Energy and Power Subcommittee. As Ranking Member, one of Rush's top priorities has been to increase opportunities for minorities within all sectors of the energy industry. In this Congress, Rush has introduced the 21st Century Energy Workforce Development Jobs Initiative Act of 2014 (H.R. 4526). This bipartisan bill establishes a comprehensive program to improve the education and training of workers for energy-related jobs, with an emphasis on increasing the number of skilled minorities and women trained to work in such jobs.Continuing to place a high priority on ensuring access to quality healthcare, Rush introduced the Trauma Relief Access for Urgent Medical Assistance of 2014 (H.R. 4181). In addition to increasing funding for research in emergency medical care systems and emergency medicine, this bill establishes grants for regionalized systems for emergency care response, trauma care centers, to promote access to trauma care services, and grants for demonstration projects for the expansion and improvement of emergency medical services for children. The United States recently received a D+ for trauma preparedness with a few states receiving an F in a study conducted by the American College of Emergency Medical Physicians. This bill seeks to improve on this national epidemic by providing the necessary resources to reduce the effects of Trauma Deserts on our urban and rural communities.Today, Rush continues to carve an effective course of sound legislative leadership that protects consumers, supports our military personnel, creates jobs, expands businesses, and promotes America's national energy policy.

She is a member of the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, House Budget Committee, as well as the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where she serves as Ranking Member of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, and as a member of the Health and Oversight & Investigations Subcommittees.  In 2010, then Speaker Pelosi appointed Schakowsky to serve on President Obama's 18-member National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. She opposed the deficit reduction proposal presented by co-chairs Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson and offered her own approach, which reached the same fiscal goals without cutting Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. The Schakowsky plan addresses the real and growing problem of income disparity - which is at its greatest level since 1928 - and protects middle-class families. In Congress, Schakowsky focuses on health care and senior issues. She was a leader in passing the historic Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to provide healthcare coverage to all Americans.  Schakowsky was responsible for provisions in the law to require improved review of insurance company premiums, nursing home quality protections, and initiatives to increase the number of health care providers, which benefit seniors and all Americans. A champion for the nation's seniors, Schakowsky continues the fight to prevent the privatization of Social Security and Medicare, and to make prescription drugs more affordable. She spearheaded the creation of the Seniors Task Force in the 111th Congress and continues to serve as Co-Chair in the 112th Congress.Schakowsky believes the number one priority in this Congress is to create jobs and restore a vibrant middle class.  She has introduced the Patriot Corporations of America Act, to reward companies that hire American workers and to eliminate tax incentives to businesses for sending jobs overseas.  She introduced the Fairness in Taxation Act to create higher tax brackets for millionaires and billionaires. Her legislation would raise over $78 billion in 2011, avoiding the need to make cuts to programs for  job creation and training, medical research, education, energy independence, and other national priorities. A leading advocate for women's issues in Congress, Schakowsky has long been involved in the fight to protect women's reproductive freedom. She continues her work to prevent violence against immigrant women, achieve economic parity, and establish transitional housing for women and children who are victims of abuse. Schakowsky is the sponsor of the International Violence Against Women Act, which would make the safety of women and girls around the world a long overdue U.S. foreign policy priority.Schakowsky has consistently voted for measures to support Israel's peace and security. She strongly supports helping Israel reach a negotiated two-state solution with the Palestinians. As a Jewish Congresswoman, Schakowsky has a deep personal connection to the State of Israel and pledges a continued friendship.Throughout her time in Congress, Schakowsky has won major legislative victories. These include important provisions in the Affordable Care Act, laws that protect seniors from abusive terms in reverse mortgages, require greater transparency for military contractors, require the strongest possible mandatory safety standards and testing for infant and toddler products - including high chairs, cribs and bath seats - and also that require strict car safety measures to protect children.A longtime grassroots organizer and consumer advocate, Schakowsky began her leadership career in 1969 when she led the fight that put freshness dates on products sold in the supermarket. Prior to her election to Congress, Schakowsky represented the 18th District in the Illinois General Assembly for eight years. She served as a Democratic Floor Leader and as Secretary of the Conference of Women Legislators. For twenty years before her election to the Illinois State House, Schakowsky fought for the public interest and rights of Illinois citizens.

In that role, she serves as a Co-Chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. She also serves as a Senior Whip in the Democratic Caucus. In both of these roles, she is a relentless advocate for steering the Democratic agenda to address the very real economic challenges millions of Americans struggle with at the kitchen table each night.Cheri has also remained committed to serving as a Watchdog in Washington. At a time when many hardworking families are tightening their belts, she's relentlessly worked across the aisle to ensure Illinoisans' hard-earned tax dollars are put to good use. Her efforts have resulted in legislation decreasing improper payments from Federal agencies, strengthening the oversight of government charge cards and ensuring Federal agencies maximize their space and manufacturing capacity before outsourcing work. Cheri is also a founding member of the bi-partisan Reformers Caucus which exclusively focuses on reforms to Congress and the legislative process.As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, Cheri played an important role in helping develop and pass the first long-term Farm Bill in years during her first term in office. Today, she is again working to pass a truly bipartisan Farm Bill. She kicked off this effort during her 21st Century Heartland tour to better understand the needs of our family farmers. Sitting around kitchen tables, in barns and garages across the 17th Congressional District, she asked hundreds of our farmers and agricultural producers what worked for them in the last Farm Bill and what they need from a new one.Cheri also serves on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. After meetings with local stakeholders, workers and transportation experts, Cheri worked with members of both parties to pass the first long-term highway bill in more than a decade. This bill brought billions of dollars back to Illinois to help put hardworking men and women back to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, rail lines and inland waterways. She is now working on the current transportation bill.Additional background about Cheri's life before Congress-Born in Springfield, Illinois, Cheri Callahan Bustos comes from a long line of farmers and teachers and grew up in a family that loved sports and their community.The granddaughter of a hog farmer and a nurse and the daughter of a social worker and a newsman, Cheri was the youngest of three children.Her dad would go on to work in public service and Major League Baseball. Her mom would go on to be a preschool teacher.  She is proud of her agricultural roots.She followed her dad into the news business. While covering the police beat as a reporter in the Quad-Cities, Cheri met a rookie cop named Gerry Bustos who she fell in love with and married. With Gerry, who now serves as the Sheriff of Rock Island County, they raised three sons and they now have two grandchildren, all of whom proudly call Illinois home.Throughout her career in journalism, Cheri used her pen to help her community. She uncovered numerous stories of corruption and greed in government, winning awards for her work on behalf of the public interest.After a career in investigative journalism, Cheri worked in health care before, during and after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, for one of the nation's largest non-denominational, non-profit health care systems. There, she helped families access affordable coverage and worked to improve the quality of health care available in the community.Cheri has long been active in her community and served on numerous nonprofit boards and as the President of The Women's Connection, which was at the time one of Illinois' largest women's membership organizations. In 2007, Cheri's commitment to public service and desire to further give back to the community led her to run for local office.Cheri was elected to serve on the City Council in East Moline for two terms and made her top priority economic development. She led the removal of downtown blight and the development of the largest construction project in downtown East Moline in generations- a nonprofit health clinic.In 2013, she was sworn into her first term in Congress, representing the hardworking families of the 17th Congressional District. And she hasn't stopped fighting for them ever since.Cheri earned her Bachelor's Degree in government and politics from the University of Maryland, College Park, and a Master's Degree in Public Affairs Reporting from the University of Illinois at Springfield.

In that position he reformed and modernized the office to provide Hoosier investors, businesses, and voters with immensely better service while promoting Indiana's economic vitality and prosperity. Rokita directed his office from 2003 to 2011 using the same budget that was used in 1987, unadjusted for inflation. He proved to be a leader in nationwide election reforms by implementing Indiana's landmark voter identification law, which he successfully defended to the United States Supreme Court in 2008. In Congress, Representative Rokita remains committed to maintaining the core values of limited government, constitutionalism, and free enterprise. That is why he works tirelessly to bring that same reform-minded approach to Washington, D.C., focusing on reducing spending and the national debt while reforming entitlements through common-sense changes to all areas of the federal government. If left untouched, these entitlements threaten to saddle our children and grandchildren with more than $100 trillion in unpaid bills.As Vice Chairman of the influential House Budget Committee, Rokita continues to work diligently to craft a budget that balances and lays out bold reforms to reduce our debt load for the next generation. During his first year as Vice Chairman, Representative Rokita was instrumental in writing and passing the first bicameral budget in over a decade. This budget would have balanced in our debt in 10 years, and put a repeal of Obamacare on the President's desk. Moving forward, Rokita will continue to promote a balanced budget amendment and other budget  measures that will increase the likelihood of on-time budgets and permit better Congressional review of agency budgets in order to eliminate billions of dollars in wasted allocations to unnecessary and duplicative programs.As a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, Congressman Rokita strives to ensure regulatory reform for Hoosier job creators and a strong educational system that guarantees local control, while preparing our children to compete in a global economy. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, Rokita introduced the Student Success Act, and co-authored the Every Student Succeeds Act which replaced No Child Left Behind. According to the Wall Street Journal, this act represents ""the largest devolution of federal control to the states in a quarter-century"" and is a major step forward. Additionally, in an ongoing battle to reform bureaucracy, Congressman Rokita's Red Tape Rollback initiative has succeeded in changing or delaying implementation of more than 20 regulations that would have been harmful to Indiana's job creators and employees.In the 114th Congress, Representative Rokita was selected to join the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee as its only Republican member from ""The Crossroads of America."" Rokita brings a depth of knowledge to his role, helping to lead the first long-term highway infrastructure bill in over a decade to enactment. As an active member of the Committee, Representative Rokita will continue to fight to bring our transportation technologies into the 21st Century by encouraging innovation and private investment.Throughout his career Rokita has established himself as a leader. Elected as the nation's youngest Secretary of State at the time, Rokita was selected by his peers to serve as President of the National Association of Secretaries of State from 2007 to 2008.  As Secretary of State, Rokita was awarded the Friend of Foreign Services Medal in recognition of his leadership and diplomatic efforts in building a strong Indiana-Taiwan partnership.

Upon graduation in 1993, Comer entered the business world, taking out a loan to purchase his first farm and dive into his career. Today that business, Comer Family Farms, is one of the largest farming operations in south central Kentucky.After his first election in 2000, Comer served for six terms as a member of the Kentucky State House, where he was lauded for his success as a legislator. He was named the National Republican Freshman Legislator of the Year during his first term and was regarded as one of the most conservative, pro-business legislators in Frankfort.Upon being elected Kentucky's Commissioner of Agriculture in 2011, Comer cleaned up the Kentucky Department of Agriculture which was beset by scandal, corruption, and a lack of accountability. His work to root out wasteful spending and fraud, return taxpayer dollars to the treasury, and grow Kentucky's agricultural economy received bipartisan acclaim. He promoted rural economic development by spearheading the successful effort to legalize industrial hemp and developed new branding initiatives for Kentucky farmers.This record of conservatism, accomplishment, and bipartisanship is exactly what Comer has brought to Washington D.C. He's a fierce advocate for rebuilding our nation's infrastructure, balancing the federal budget, and implementing business-friendly policies, including regulatory reform. These are his chief priorities in the 115th Congress.Comer is married to TJ Comer, and father to Reagan, 12, Harlan, 9, and Aniston, 5.

He attended Burncoat Elementary School and then Worcester Academy. By seventh grade, Jim knew he wanted to make a difference. He volunteered on the 1972 presidential campaign of Senator George McGovern (D-SD) - no relation - and held signs and knocked doors for the Senator's anti-war campaign.Later, he managed Senator McGovern's second presidential campaign in Massachusetts, delivering his 1984 nominating speech during the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco.Jim attended The American University in Washington, D.C. where he earned both his bachelor's degree in History ('81) and his Master's Degree in Public Administration ('84). He worked his way through college as an intern in the office of Senator George McGovern. Jim worked for Massachusetts Congressman John Joseph Moakley (D-South Boston) from 1982 until 1996, serving as a staff assistant, press secretary, and legislative director.In 1989, Congressman Moakley asked Jim to be the lead staffer in the investigation of the murders of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter in El Salvador. He exposed that the murders were committed by the U.S. - backed Salvadoran military, leading to a major shift in U.S. foreign policy. After Jim's discovery, future military aid from the U.S. was contingent on improved human rights and a negotiated peace in El Salvador. It was while working in Moakley's office that Jim met his wife, Lisa Murray McGovern, who was an aide to Congressman Gerry Studds (D-MA).

Five years later, in 1991, he announced his candidacy for President of the United States.  Niki helped her husband run an inspired campaign that many observers say defined the national debate that year.  Sadly, in 1996, Paul faced a second, well-known fight, this time with complications from cancer treatments, which he lost in 1997.Prior to being elected to Congress, she was the Dean of External Affairs at Middlesex Community College.  As a committed community leader in Lowell, serving on the Lowell Civic Stadium and Arena Commission which oversees the LeLacheur Ballpark and previously oversaw the Tsongas Arena (now the UMass Lowell Tsongas Center), the Lowell Plan, the Merrimack Repertory Theater and the Pollard Memorial Library Board of Trustees, Niki continued to work for the revitalization of the city she has called home for 40 years.  And, she's been a member of numerous corporate and non-profit boards because of her strong belief that business must be constructively engaged in the fight for social and environmental justice. She was elected in a 2007 Special Election to represent the people of the Fifth District, which was renamed the Third District after her most recent reelection in 2012.Niki is most proud of her three daughters, Ashley, Katina and Molly, who like their parents, have also met the call of public service. In recent years, the Tsongas family has welcomed two new members, Niki's grandson Declan and her granddaughter Nina."

He was also appointed to chair the Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement, which resulted in the establishment of the Office of Congressional Ethics, and what the Washington Post called ""a significant improvement over the current process."" In March of 2008, his resolution establishing an Office of Congressional Ethics passed, involving non-Members of the House in ethics matters for the first time in history.

He currently serves on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, in addition to the Subcommittee on Health and the Subcommittee on Energy and Power. Since 2017, he has chaired the Democracy Reform Task Force, a bold effort in the House of Representatives to build a government that puts public interest ahead special interests.Born and raised in Baltimore, Congressman Sarbanes has experience working in the private, public and nonprofit sectors. He and his family live in Towson, giving him the opportunity to drive home every night and hear from people he serves in Congress. Listening to their concerns allows him to better represent Maryland and has shaped his work in the House of Representatives.As chair of the Democracy Reform Task Force, Congressman Sarbanes works to confront the Trump Administration's conflicts of interest and ethical lapses, and to fight back against special-interest policies in Congress, while advancing positive reforms to improve accountability and transparency in government. Congressman Sarbanes is also committed to reducing the influence of the wealthy and well-connected in politics. To this end, he has authored the Government By the People Act (H.R. 20), which aims to empower everyday Americans by elevating their voices in Congress.As a Marylander, Congressman Sarbanes shares his state's strong tradition of environmentalism that is rooted in a passion for the Chesapeake Bay. He has led efforts in Congress to clean up the Chesapeake Bay with a particular focus on empowering residents of the Bay watershed to become citizen stewards of the Bay and give them an active role in restoring it. He has also worked to expand environmental education opportunities for children, authoring the No Child Left Inside Act to promote healthier children and communities.Congressman Sarbanes is a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) because he believes it has reduced the cost of health care, improved our nation's health care system and provided access for those who previously did not have insurance. He will continue to oppose any efforts to repeal the ACA unless a replacement is offered that maintains affordable coverage for the 20 million Americans who gained insurance under the law and that includes critical consumer protections - like the requirement that insurers cover those with pre-existing conditions and the ban on annual and lifetime coverage limits. While the ACA is not a perfect bill, it was a crucial step in the right direction - away from the influence of powerful special interests and toward commonsense solutions for American families.Congressman Sarbanes has fought to expand higher education opportunities through financial assistance programs like the Pell Grant and has authored laws to help students repay their college loans after they graduate. In this effort, Congressman Sarbanes wrote a law to create the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Option, which provides graduates with forgiveness of remaining student loan debt after 10 years of work in public service or the non-profit sector. The new law helps teachers, nurses, first responders and other public servants pay for college. It allows more people to follow their dreams in careers that are important and rewarding, but not always particularly lucrative.Before coming to Congress, Congressman Sarbanes served for seven years with the Maryland State Department of Education, working to make Maryland's public school system one of the best in the nation. He practiced law for eighteen years, representing hospitals and senior living providers in their mission to deliver high-quality health care to the people of Maryland. Congressman Sarbanes also worked with public interest organizations in Maryland, like the Public Justice Center, where he championed efforts to protect consumers, provide decent public housing and ensure fair treatment in the workplace.Congressman Sarbanes graduated from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University and studied law and politics in Greece on a Fulbright Scholarship.

Living on the offshore island of North Haven, Maine, she raised her kids and ran a small business. She served on the school board and as the local tax assessor, a job no one else in town wanted. But in 1991, when she was approached about running for State Senate, she jumped at the chance.She scored a remarkable upset, defeating a popular Republican, and went on to serve four terms in the Maine Senate. But throughout her political career, from Augusta to Washington and beyond, the lessons she learned on North Haven have always been her guide- Be accountable to your neighbors, and always use your common sense.Chellie Johnson (she has legally changed her name from ""Rochelle"") was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1955, the youngest of four children. Her father, Harry, worked in advertising and her mother, Dorothy, was a nurse. Chellie moved to Maine as a teenager, attended the University of Southern Maine, and graduated from the College of the Atlantic, in Bar Harbor. After college, she moved to North Haven, an island town of 350 people twelve miles off the coast of Rockland, to raise her family and make a living.Chellie has worked hard throughout her life - as a mother, as a farmer, as a small business owner, and in politics. She knows how difficult it can be to meet payroll and run a business in a small, rural community. Right after college, Chellie and her husband, Charlie, spent several years running a small farm and selling produce locally. In 1981, she started North Island Yarn, a cottage industry of local knitters, with a retail store on the island. The business expanded quickly, becoming North Island Designs, and employed as many as ten local workers in peak seasons. The business sold knitting kits and pattern books nationwide through 500 retail stores and 100,000 mail order catalogues. She sold the business in 1993.Today, in addition to her political life, Chellie co-owns and helps manage Nebo Lodge, a bed & breakfast and restaurant on North Haven, which she started with several partners in 2006.Chellie was elected to the Maine State Senate in 1992, representing Knox County. In 1996, Chellie was chosen by her peers to be the Maine Senate Majority Leader. She helped lead the Senate for four more years, until leaving office due to term limits. As a Senator, she fought for economic and social justice, taking on powerful adversaries - most notably the pharmaceutical lobby. In her last session, Pingree sponsored one of the nation's first prescription drug pricing bills, MaineRX. After a legal fight that led all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, the bill became law, and has since been a model for states around the country working to lower prescription drug prices.Chellie also sponsored the successful ""Parents as Scholars"" program, a national model for welfare reform, which continues to help working Maine parents gain access to education to help them achieve a better life for their families. She led successful efforts to protect Maine's environment, for corporate accountability, to protect workers, to promote a women's right to choose, and in support of Maine's small businesses. As a state Senator, Chellie was also a founding member of the Maine Economic Growth Council.Pingree's leadership in Maine politics led to numerous international appointments. She traveled to Hungary as an Eisenhower Exchange Fellow, served as a member of the White House delegation to observe elections in Bosnia, and was a member of a U.S. delegation to Northern Ireland, working with women political leaders there.After being term-limited from the Maine Senate in 2000, Pingree challenged incumbent U.S. Senator Susan Collins in 2002. As one of the few outspoken opponents of the Iraq War running for U.S. Senate, Chellie mounted a strong, but ultimately unsuccessful campaign.From 2003 to 2007, Chellie served as the National President and CEO of Common Cause, a non-partisan citizen activist group with nearly 300,000 members and 35 state chapters. Common Cause's mission is to help citizens make their voices heard in the political process and to hold their elected leaders accountable to the public interest. Under Chellie's leadership, Common Cause increased its membership and diversified its agenda to include limiting media concentration and consolidation, promoting Net Neutrality, and election reform, while continuing to pursue its traditional goals of campaign finance reform and oversight of government ethics and accountability.In 2008 Chellie was elected to Congress from Maine's 1st Congressional District-the first woman elected to Congress from that District. It also marks the first time in American history that women make up the majority of a state's Congressional Delegation.Chellie has three grown children. Her eldest, Hannah, is former Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, is married to filmmaker Jason Mann, and is mother to Chellie's granddaughter, Elsie, and grandson, Oscar. Her daughter Cecily, another filmmaker, is currently working with Penobscot Bay East Resource Center on a film about Maine's fishing industry. And her son, Asa, is a small business owner and proud father of Chellie's first grandson, Smith."

Those are the same values that guided him during his more than 25 years in concurrent military and private industry leadership roles, and they're the same values that are guiding him as he works for Michigan's First District in Congress.The Bergman family roots in Michigan run deep-as early as the 1800s, Jack's ancestors were earning a living in the iron mines in the Upper Peninsula. After a series of moves required by his military career, Jack and his wife Cindy came back home to Michigan and settled in Watersmeet.Jack is a Constitutional conservative who is adamant that public service should be about people and not about process.

A diverse section of the state that stretches from the shores of Lake Michigan, the Sixth District is home to key industries that range from agriculture to auto parts manufacturing to high-tech biomedical innovation centers. It includes all of Berrien, Cass, Kalamazoo, St. Joseph and Van Buren counties, and most of Allegan County.Prior to his election to Congress, Fred worked for President Ronald Reagan in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). While at OMB, he learned from President Reagan's example that it does not matter who gets the credit, as long as the job gets done. That has been Fred's approach since he was first elected to Congress in 1986 and continues today.From 2010 to 2016, Fred was selected by his House colleagues to serve as Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. This pivotal committee has jurisdiction over matters concerning energy, healthcare, the environment, telecommunications, commerce, manufacturing, and trade, as well as oversight and investigations. Hard work and bipartisan success was a staple during Fred's tenure as chairman of the committee. In fact, under Fred's leadership, the Committee passed 354 legislative measures through the House of Representatives and saw 202 of those measures signed into law by the president. Fred currently serves as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy. This pivotal panel has jurisdiction over national energy policy. Fred's top priorities remain job creation, economic growth, and working to help all residents of Southwest Michigan live longer, better lives.Fred has long pushed for a greater emphasis on biomedical research to improve the public health. In 2014, along with Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colorado, Fred launched the 21st Century Cures initiative. This multi-year effort aims to bring researchers, industry, and patients together to speed up the discovery, development, and delivery of life-saving cures. The pursuit of these 21st century cures also supports Southwest Michigan employers and jobs by ensuring the United States remains the world leader in medical innovation. Marking the culmination of a three-year journey, President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act into law on December 13, 2016.Fred's leadership on Great Lakes issues has earned him a local and national reputation. As an active member of the Great Lakes caucus, Fred has an extensive record working to protect the Great Lakes watershed and preserving the beauty and health of our lakes for generations to come. A leader on keeping BP from dumping pollutants into Lake Michigan, Fred has also been a bipartisan leader in preventing Asian Carp and other invasive species from entering our waterways, and working on bipartisan legislation to keep harmful pollutants like synthetic plastic microbeads from getting into Lake Michigan. Fred will continue to protect our treasured Great Lakes so that generations to come can enjoy their beauty.Fred has worked tirelessly to ensure Southwest Michigan remains a hub of commerce and innovation. From the Harbor Shores project in St. Joseph/Benton Harbor and working to ensure the St. Joseph Harbor remains dredged and operational, to the widening of I-94 and working with local leaders on the Kalamazoo River Superfund cleanup, Fred understands that when Southwest Michigan is connected and its residents empowered, it thrives.Fred works hard to ensure that Michigan service members and veterans receive the benefits they have earned through years of service. From improving health care for our veterans, to improving the disability benefit system or getting veterans back to work, and providing overdue service medals, Fred has a strong record of supporting our brave veterans and their families. In addition, Fred has been working closely with the U.S. Department of Defense to get the Missile Defense Agency Project approved for the Fort Custer Training Center.Fred has led the effort to ensure seniors keep access to their physicians and low-income children keeping their insurance coverage. In April of 2015, President Obama signed into law H.R. 2, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, which permanently fixes the broken Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate, strengthens Medicare in the long-term, extends federal funding for community health centers, and extends the Children's Health Insurance Program (MIChild) which covers nearly 45,000 children in Michigan.Fred strongly supports an ""all of the above"" energy strategy that says yes to energy and focuses on emerging clean energy technologies as well as traditional energy solutions that lower costs for families and businesses and helps America become free from reliance on foreign oil. Fred is also fighting to bring a halt to costly federal rules and regulations that needlessly slow private-sector growth. Fred believes in ensuring that the federal government remains limited, transparent, and accountable to Southwest Michiganders.Fred has also remained committed to helping residents of Southwest Michigan who run into snags dealing directly with the federal government. He maintains two constituent district offices, located in Benton Harbor/St. Joseph (269-982-1986) and Kalamazoo (269-385-0039) as well as Washington D.C. (202-225-3761), where dedicated caseworkers serve as intermediaries to help them navigate the system.Fred was born on April 23, 1953, and holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Michigan.

He was also singled out by TIME magazine for his leadership in keeping America out of war with Syria. His leadership across the board has earned him praise from various Labor, business and consumer groups throughout the nation.Rick grew up in Brainerd, Minnesota on the Cuyuna Range in the heart of the state's lake country. His father, Hank, was a postal worker. His mother, Mary, was a homemaker who supplemented the family income in the area resort industry. Along with his brother, Jim, and sister, Mary Pat, Rick began his lifelong enjoyment of hunting, fishing and the outdoors at an early age.A father of 4 and grandfather of 10, Rick has been married to Mary Nolan for more than 30 years. The Nolan homestead in rural Crosby is a regular gathering place for 5 generations of Nolans who together tap maple syrup in the spring, harvest wild rice in the fall, and never miss a hunting or fishing opener.Rick worked his way through the University of Minnesota as a proud Local 638 UPS Teamster, and later taught high school social studies in Royalton, Minnesota.  He directed the North Central Minnesota 19-unit Head Start program and was curriculum coordinator for the Little Falls Adult Education program.

In the ensuing years, he devoted much of his professional energy to generating Minnesota jobs through exports and trade. Establishing his own business, U.S. Export Corporation, he worked with then Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich to build and operate the Minnesota World Trade Center in downtown St. Paul. He later served as president of the Minnesota World Trade Center Corporation and chaired the International Association of World Trade Centers' Trade and Policy Committee, the world's largest private sector international trade group.Rick is also the former owner of Emily Wood Products, a small sawmill and pallet factory in the northern Minnesota community of Emily.

In the 114th Congress she was named Chairwoman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee to oversee the Administration's defense policies and ensure accountability within the Department of Defense.Growing up on a farm in rural Cass County, Vicky learned the value of hard work, family values, love of country and a reliance on faith to guide her in life. After graduating from Archie High School, Vicky earned her Bachelor's degree from the University of Missouri and her Master's degree in Education from the University of Central Missouri. As a public school teacher for 11 years, she understands the importance of state and local control of education.

Leonard Wood and Whiteman Air Force Base, and as a daughter of a U.S. Army Reservist, Vicky's commitment to our men and women in uniform is unwavering. During her first term in Congress, Vicky took on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which had ordered the destruction of 1,200 homes and other structures at the Lake of the Ozarks as part of its approval of a Shoreline Management Plan needed to operate the hydroelectric plant at the Lake. Her determination and refusal to back down led FERC to rescind the order, protecting the existing property rights of local landowners.Vicky also worked to pass the Small Business Credit Availability Act to provide regulatory relief to community banks, rural electric cooperatives, and local businesses from burdensome Dodd-Frank regulations. Originally intended to be exempt from Dodd-Frank, these entities were not immune from the federal government's attempts to regulate every aspect of these industries. As a small business owner, Vicky appreciates the value of our local Main Street businesses, and works hard every day to combat the executive overreach of unelected bureaucrats so hometown businesses can thrive and Missouri families can prosper.Vicky believes providing for the common defense of our country is among the highest duties of the U.S. Congress.

She joins with the rest of America in her gratitude for their service, and hosts a Veterans Resource Fair for Missouri's Fourth District annually, giving veterans valuable in-person access to national service providers and veterans service organizations.Representing the agricultural interests of her district, Vicky helped craft the 2014 Farm Bill which strengthened the safety net for farmers and ensured a safe, affordable food supply while saving $24 billion and eliminating more than 100 unnecessary programs. In addition to the Farm Bill, Rep. Hartzler led a successful effort to increase transparency in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's audit process to allow for more transparent dealings between the agency and Missouri livestock markets.Other recent accomplishments include-A House passed provision to increase maintenance funding for dilapidated World War II-era army ammunition plants, including the Lake City Plant in Independence, Missouri;A House-passed bill to ensure the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) remain accountable to local stakeholders and victims of natural disasters during the critical recovery phase;A House-passed measure to boost funding for Department of Defense peer-reviewed research on Alzheimer's, the nation's sixth-leading cause of death and the only one in the top ten with no cure or treatment; andA committee-passed provision to eliminate the federal one-size-fits-all school lunch pricing scheme and return this decision making power to local schools and schoolboards.Vicky remains committed to serving the constituents of Missouri's Fourth District, which includes preserving the sanctity of life and working to protect traditional family values. Through her work as a co-chair of the House Values Action Team, she has worked tirelessly to ensure pro-life and pro-family provisions are included in all relevant legislation. Rep.

As a young man, Frank would become a successful small businessman himself, working for more than 26 years at his family-owned and operated trucking company. He would be an active participant in numerous civic and charitable efforts, including the SPCA, the Cumberland County Guidance Center, the local YMCA and rotary. And, with the foundation of these accomplishments, he would be asked by local leaders and private citizens to continue his service by running for public office.Starting with his successful election to the Cumberland County Board of Chosen Freeholders in 1984, Frank has served South Jersey on the county, state and federal levels ever since. After three years on the Freeholders Board, he went on to being elected to the New Jersey General Assembly, representing the First Legislative District from 1988-1994. In November 1994, Frank won election to the U.S. House of Representative, serving constituents from New Jersey's Second Congressional District to this day.On Capitol Hill, Congressman LoBiondo is a member of the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee. He takes great pride in serving as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation, given its critical importance to South Jersey. He is also pleased to sit on the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit and the Subcommittee on Coast Guard & Maritime Transportation - both of which have jurisdiction over critical issues that affect New Jersey's growing and ever-changing transportation needs.

And, appointed in the 112th Congress, Frank serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence where he serves as Chairman of the newly-created 10-member CIA Subcommittee with oversight over the Central Intelligence Agency.Known across the extensive district - roughly one-third geographically of the entire state - as a fierce supporter of veterans, Frank continues to work hard to expand access to community-based health care providers thus minimizing the need for South Jersey veterans to commute outside the state for VA-approved services. His unwavering efforts have resulted in establishing and expanding outpatient clinics in Cape May, Vineland and Northfield, additional medical services provided at the Veterans Memorial Home and a VA-handicap transport van for veterans needing extensive medical treatment.Drawing from his childhood love of the outdoors, Frank has always maintained a strong commitment to protecting the environment. Throughout his time in public office, he has worked to protect fragile wildlife and wetlands areas and stood up for projects that will preserve and restore the New Jersey coastline. His work in Congress has won recognition from many environmental groups including the Audubon Society, the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club.Reflecting on his background in business, Frank has been a strong voice for the private sector. He believes it is not the government, but private businesses which create jobs and grow the economy. He has also supported efforts to increase total transparency in the process of allocating taxpayer dollars. Additionally, showing that fiscal restraint begins with the individual, Frank returns the unused funds each year from his congressional office's account to the U.S. Treasury. He has spent among the least any current member who has served since 1995.Born on May 12, 1946, Frank went on to receive his B.A. in Business Administration from St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia before returning home to Cumberland County.

In 1992, she was the first Puerto Rican woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. In February 1998, she was named Ranking Democratic Member of the House Small Business Committee, making her the first Hispanic woman to serve as Ranking Member of a full House committee. Most recently, in 2006, she was named Chairwoman of the House Small Business Committee, making her the first Latina to chair a full Congressional committee.Given these achievements, her roots are humble. She was born in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico - a small town of sugar-cane fields - in 1953, and was one of nine children. Velazquez started school early, skipped several grades, and became the first person in her family to receive a college diploma. At the age of 16, she entered the University of Puerto Rico in Rio Piedras. She graduated magna cum laude in 1974 with a degree in political science. After earning a master's degree on scholarship from N.Y.U., Velazquez taught Puerto Rican studies at CUNY's Hunter College in 1981.But her passion for politics soon took hold. In 1983, Velazquez was appointed Special Assistant to Congressman Edolphus Towns (D-Brooklyn). One year later, she became the first Latina appointed to serve on the New York City Council.By 1986, Velazquez served as the Director of the Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs in the United States. During that time, she initiated one of the most successful Latino empowerment programs in the nation's history - ""Atrevete"" (Dare to Go for It!).In 1992, after months of running a grassroots political campaign, Velazquez was elected to the House of Representatives to represent New York's 7th District. Her district, which encompasses parts of Brooklyn, Queens and the Lower East Side of Manhattan, is the only tri-borough district in the New York City congressional delegation. Encompassing many diverse neighborhoods, it is home to a large Latino population, with pockets of Polish communities, and parts of Chinatown.As a fighter for equal rights of the underrepresented and a proponent of economic opportunity for the working class and poor, Congresswoman Velazquez combines sensibility and compassion, as she works to encourage economic development, protect community health and the environment, combat crime and worker abuses, and secure access to affordable housing, quality education and health care for all New York City families.As the top Democrat on the House Small Business Committee, which oversees federal programs and contracts totaling $200 billion annually, Congresswoman Velazquez has been a vocal advocate of American small business and entrepreneurship. She has established numerous small business legislative priorities, encompassing the areas of tax, regulations, access to capital, federal contracting opportunities, trade, technology, health care and pension reform, among others. Congresswoman Velazquez was named as the inaugural ""Woman of the Year"" by Hispanic Business Magazine in recognition of her national influence in both the political and business sectors and for her longtime support of minority enterprise.Although her work on the Small Business Committee and the House Financial Services Committee (where she is the most senior New York Member on the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity) keeps her busy, Congresswoman Velazquez can often be found close to home, working for the residents of her district."

Serving his third term in the United States Congress, Rep. Jeffries is a member of the House Judiciary Committee and House Budget Committee.Rep. Jeffries is a Co-Chair of the House Democratic Policy & Communications Committee, having been elected to that position overwhelmingly by his colleagues. In that capacity, he is a member of the Democratic Leadership Team and helps run the messaging apparatus for the House Democrats.He is also the former Whip of the Congressional Black Caucus. Presently, Rep. Jeffries co-chairs the bipartisan Intellectual Property Caucus and is a founder of the Criminal Justice & the Public Safety Caucus.In Congress, Rep. Jeffries has emerged as a tireless advocate for social and economic justice.  He has worked hard to help residents impacted by the devastation of Superstorm Sandy, reform our criminal justice system, improve the economy for hardworking Americans and make college more affordable.Rep. Jeffries begins each Congress determined to lead in a bipartisan manner. Last term, he teamed up with Rep. Peter King to pass the Slain Officer Family Support Act of 2015, a bill that extended the tax deadline so that individuals making charitable donations to organizations supporting the families of assassinated New York Police Department Detectives Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos could apply such tax deductions to the prior year's tax return. President Obama signed the legislation into law.On the heels of a nationwide outcry demanding meaningful police reform, Rep. Jeffries introduced the Excessive Use of Force Prevention Act of 2015, legislation that will make the deployment of a chokehold unlawful under federal civil rights law. The chokehold has been banned by the New York Police Department for more than twenty years, and prohibited or discouraged by several major police departments throughout the country. Yet, it continues to be used by law enforcement, as in the death of Eric Garner. The chokehold is an unnecessary and uncivilized tactic that this bill will make unlawful.In response to the tragic death of P.J. Avitto, a 6-year-old boy who was fatally stabbed nine times in an apartment building elevator in Brooklyn, Rep. Jeffries introduced P.J.'s Act. This bill is designed to increase access to federal funding for enhanced safety and security in public housing developments. The legislation will make the purchase, installation and maintenance of security cameras, enhanced lighting and locking mechanisms an eligible category in statute for the purpose of securing Community Development Block Grant funding.  In the 113th Congress, Rep. Jeffries successfully passed H.R. 5108, legislation that established the Law School Clinic Certification Program of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) into law. This program had been operating in a pilot capacity since 2008, and allows students at participating law schools to gain experience in patent and trademark law while providing legal assistance to inventors, tech entrepreneurs, and small businesses. The bipartisan bill, which was signed into law by President Obama, expands the current program by removing its ""pilot"" status, making it available to all accredited law schools in the country that meet the program's eligibility requirements.While he remains committed to working diligently in Washington on behalf of New York's Eighth Congressional District, Rep. Jeffries also works tirelessly to keep in close contact with constituents. In January, the Congressman begins each year with a well-attended State of the District Address. During the spring and summer, he holds ""Congress on Your Corner"" outdoor office hours throughout the district. At each stop, the Congressman sets up a table in front of a local post office or on a neighborhood corner and constituents are able to meet with him one-on-one without appointment. He also hosts telephone town hall meetings in the form of regularly-scheduled calls that provide an opportunity for participants to speak directly with the Congressman about local and national issues. On each occasion, thousands of people participate.Prior to his election to the Congress, Rep. Jeffries served for six years in the New York State Assembly. In that capacity, he authored laws that included protecting the civil liberties of law-abiding New Yorkers during police encounters, encouraging the transformation of vacant luxury condominiums into affordable homes for working families, and improving the quality of justice in the civil court system.Congressman Jeffries obtained his bachelor's degree in political science from the State University of New York at Binghamton, where he graduated with honors for outstanding academic achievement. He then received his master's degree in public policy from Georgetown University. Thereafter, Rep. Jeffries attended New York University School of Law, where he graduated magna cum laude and served on the Law Review.Following the completion of law school, Congressman Jeffries clerked for the Honorable Harold Baer Jr. of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. He practiced law for several years at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, an internationally renowned law firm, and then served as counsel in the litigation department of two Fortune 500 companies, Viacom Inc. and CBS. He also worked as of counsel at Godosky & Gentile, a well-regarded litigation firm in New York City.Rep. Jeffries was born in Brooklyn Hospital and raised in Crown Heights. He is a product of New York City's public school system having graduated from Midwood High School and currently lives in Prospect Heights with his family."

Before being elected to Congress, Joe received a bachelor's degree from Queens College, helped operate a family-owned business, and represented the 30th Assembly District in the New York State legislature. Throughout his career in public service, Joe has been driven by a desire to protect New York's middle class.As Chairman of the Democratic Caucus, the fourth-highest ranking position in House Democratic Leadership, Joe's efforts in Congress are focused on building strong communities, creating jobs, increasing access to health care and housing, protecting seniors' hard-earned benefits, and opening up educational opportunities for working families. His seat on the prestigious Committee on Ways and Means allows Joe to work directly on issues of importance to the residents of the 14th District - keeping Medicare and Social Security strong, improving health care for all Americans and creating a fair and equitable tax code for American families and small businesses.Joe is dedicated to making the Bronx-Queens community more prosperous and secure. He established the Crime Stoppers program in 2002 to support local organizations that are working to reduce crime and improve the quality of life in our neighborhoods, and it has delivered more than $1 million in federal funding to the Bronx-Queens community for graffiti clean-up, after-school programming, and civic patrol efforts. He is focused on further strengthening and expanding urban hospitals and specialty health centers, such as the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Westchester Square. These are not only world-class medical facilities, but large and reputable employers in the area. Joe is also firmly committed to preparing all young Americans for work in the 21st century by advocating for public education, championing increased federal support for Head Start and other pre-kindergarten programs and fighting to maintain critical financial aid, such as Pell Grants, so more students can afford a college education.The 14th Congressional District is one of the most diverse areas in the country. Through his work with a range of local organizations, Joe has enriched his understanding of international affairs and become a leading voice in efforts to promote democracy and human rights around the world. He successfully introduced and passed legislation to honor Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi with the Congressional Gold Medal for her tireless efforts to bring peace and democracy to Burma. He has also fought for women's rights both in the U.S. and overseas by introducing and spearheading the passage of the Girls Protection Act, legislation that prohibits the transport of minors abroad for the purpose of female genital mutilation.Like most New Yorkers, Joe's life was profoundly changed on September 11, 2001. Tragically, his cousin, Fire Department Battalion Chief John Moran, was among the brave first responders who died that day in World Trade Center Tower 2. To make sure we never forget the sacrifices made that day, Joe spearheaded an initiative to honor the first responders who lost their lives trying to help their fellow New Yorkers with a Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor. And, to ensure that New York and the nation are better prepared for future threats, Joe led efforts to create the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) which targets homeland security funding to at-risk urban centers, such as New York City. To date, New York City has received over $950 million in funding to make our airports, train stations and ports safer and more secure. Joe was also instrumental in passing the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act to provide 9/11 first responders and workers with health monitoring and care.Both local and national media have recognized Joe for his effective and impressive record of leadership in Congress. In 2010, National Journal magazine named Joe ""a rising star"" in the Democratic Caucus and The New York Times has noted that his peers consider him to be a ""hard working representative"" who is ""an impassioned advocate for his district.""Joe has been married to his wife, Kasey Crowley, for over a decade and they have three young children."
22034,158985,"FL","H","NY","15","","Jose","Serrano","E.","Rep.","","US Representative","Narrative Bio","",2017-05-11 00:00:00,"U.S. Representative Jose E. Serrano represents the Fifteenth Congressional District of New York in the Bronx . He is the only Congressman from New York City on the exclusive House Appropriations Committee and serves as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government . Congressman Serrano is also Senior Whip for the Minority Whip operation. He is an active member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and served as Chair of the Caucus from 1993-94. He is now the most senior Member of Congress of Puerto Rican descent.Early in his tenure in the House, Serrano quickly established a legislative record that reflected, his core political values of equal opportunity and fair treatment for all citizens.  As a member of the Committee on Education and Labor in his first term, Serrano authored legislation, signed into law in November 1990, to provide funding for successful school drop-out prevention programs.During the 102nd Congress (1991-1992), Serrano continued to build on this record of accomplishment by introducing more legislative initiatives along these themes. His Voting Rights Language Assistance Act of 1992, signed into law. He also introduced the Classroom Safety Act.In 1993, Serrano joined the Appropriations Committee. Because Appropriations is an exclusive Committee, he was required to give up his seat on Education and Labor. That same year he was also elected by his colleagues to serve as Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) during the 103rd Congress. As Chairman, Serrano's strong leadership contributed to the passage of several bills of interest to Hispanics and other minorities. In 1995, Serrano was appointed to the House Judiciary Committee, in which he served on the Subcommittee on the Constitution. The Democratic Caucus re-appointed him to the Appropriations Committee in March of 1996.As a Member of the House Appropriations Committee, Serrano has managed to secure millions of dollars in federal funding for his Bronx Congressional District. Perhaps the most notable of all these projects have involved the environmental restoration of the Bronx River. Serrano has been a tireless advocate for the urban river since taking office, and was an early supporter of naming the river an American Heritage River. In recognition of his long record of successful advocacy on behalf of the river, the Bronx community named Congressman Serrano the Honorary Chairman of the Bronx River Golden Ball in 2003. In 2006, herring were reintroduced to the river in 2006--a species that had been gone from the river for more than 350 years. In early 2007, a beaver was found living in the Bronx River, marking the return of a species that had been not been seen in New York City in more than 200 years.Current IssuesEven as Serrano has been actively engaged in all stages of Congress's annual appropriations process, he has not lost sight of the other important issues of great concern to the residents of the Bronx.Pushing for a Practical National Language PolicySerrano authored the English Plus Resolution, which calls on the government to encourage all Americans to learn and use multiple languages, in addition to English. He vehemently opposes ""English only"" proposals because he believes that implementing such a policy would be harmful to civil rights and America's broader national interests. In 1996, the English Plus Resolution came close to House passage, and Serrano has proposed it again in the current Congress.Protecting Civil LibertiesCongressman Serrano has been a leading, and often lonely, voice in the House on preserving Americans' civil liberties as federal law enforcement agencies continue to transform in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He voted against the USA PATRIOT Act, and uses his positions on his Appropriations Subcommittees to monitor the activities of the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. In countless pieces of correspondence and numerous verbal exchanges during Subcommittee hearings, Serrano has unhesitatingly challenged agency heads on what he has often perceived as a systematic effort to curtail Americans' rights.Advocating a More Sensible Approach to CubaSince his earliest days in Congress, Congressman Serrano has been actively involved in ending the embargo against Cuba. He has sponsored legislation and worked tirelessly to educate other Members of Congress about how the embargo harms American businesses and American farmers. While Serrano was once part of a tiny group in Congress to support a changed approach to Cuba, growing numbers of Members join Congressman Serrano in signing on to his Bridges to the Cuban People Act each year.Promoting a Rational, Humane Immigration PolicySerrano's most recent immigration-related legislative proposal enacted into law responded to the September 11th terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. The law granted posthumous citizenship to non-citizens who died as a result of the September 11th attacks and who had already initiated the process to become U.S. citizens. Serrano succeeded in having the bill incorporated into a larger bill, which signed into law (P.L. 107-77) at the end of 2001. He is a consistent supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, and has repeatedly introduced the Child Citizen Protection Act, which would allow judges to exercise discretion in deportation cases that involve parents or guardians of citizen children."

Lowey is currently serving her fifteenth term in Congress, representing parts of Westchester and Rockland Counties. She was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1988 and served in the Democratic Leadership in 2001 and 2002 as the first woman and the first New Yorker to chair the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  She is also the first woman to lead either party on the powerful House Appropriations Committee.At the beginning of the 113th Congress, Lowey was selected by her colleagues to be the Ranking Democrat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee. Lowey is an extremely effective, committed legislator with a substantial record. Congressional Quarterly called her one of the 50 most effective Members of Congress, saying she ""maneuvers skillfully through the appropriations process"" and Newsday said she ""delivers for New York.""An outspoken supporter of transportation, nuclear, and infrastructure security, Lowey was appointed to the Select Committee on Homeland Security and recognized by the New York Post as ""a key general in the battle to rebuild New York"" for her leadership in securing over $20 billion for recovery efforts after September 11, 2001. Her efforts to distribute homeland security grants based on risk and to screen airport personnel in secure areas have been endorsed by The New York Times. Lowey has also helped to obtain more than $68 million in federal funds to develop local bioterrorism response plans and to provide local first responders with interoperable communication devices, rescue equipment, and personal protective gear.Lowey is a strong advocate for women, children, and families. She has been a champion of education throughout her career, fighting for school modernization, teacher development, and literacy programs. Under Lowey's leadership, federal funding for after-school programs has increased from $1 million in 1996 to $1 billion today.When GOP leaders threatened to eliminate the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) in the 1990s, Lowey ""invited"" puppets Bert and Ernie to a Congressional hearing. The resulting worldwide publicity is largely credited with saving the agency. When Republican leaders again targeted PBS for severe budget cuts in 2005, Lowey again successfully restored funding to the program. She has been equally stalwart in her defense of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and served on the prestigious National Council for the Arts in recognition of her leadership.Lowey is one of the Appropriations Committee's leading advocates of increased federal investments in biomedical research on diseases like cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's at the National Institutes of Health. Called a ""champion of increased funding for breast cancer research"" by The Washington Post, Lowey has received multiple honors from the National Breast Cancer Coalition.After hearing from constituents about the difficulty food-allergic consumers have reading product labels, Lowey authored the first-ever bill mandating clear, concise food allergen labeling. Her legislation was enacted in 2006, requiring food manufacturers to list in plain language on food labels the eight most common food allergens. The New York Times called this bill ""an all too rare example  of bipartisan cooperation to serve the public good.""As a candidate for Congress in 1988, Lowey pledged to clean up the Long Island Sound. In 1990 she passed legislation establishing a special Environmental Protection Agency office for Long Island Sound and has obtained millions of dollars in federal funding for local clean-up efforts. A co-founder of the Hudson River Caucus, Lowey has also taken a key role in protecting the New York City watershed and in preserving strong environmental laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.Lowey, former Chair of the Congressional Women's Caucus and the House Pro-Choice Caucus, was called ""the most prominent abortion rights advocate in Congress"" by The Washington Post. She won widespread praise for passage of her legislation to ensure that insurance companies cover prescription contraceptives for federal employees. Lowey established the Congressional Advisory Panel to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy to encourage abstinence and responsibility among teens. She has also been a leader in the fight against domestic violence, securing record increases in federal funding for battered women's shelters.On the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, Lowey has also worked to ensure that diplomacy and development remain key pillars of our national security strategy, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan. Called ""one of the engines of pro-Israel activity on Capitol Hill"" by the Forward, Lowey has been a leading Congressional proponent of a strong U.S.-Israel relationship and the Appropriations Committee's chief advocate of the annual U.S. aid package to Israel. In 2007, she was chosen by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to serve as a member of the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel, recommended by the bipartisan 9/11 Commission to coordinate classified programs and funding.Lowey was born in the Bronx; graduated from the Bronx High School of Science; and received a Bachelor's Degree from Mount Holyoke College. She served as Assistant Secretary of State for the State of New York before being elected to Congress.

Before serving as Erie County Executive, Chris built a career as a business owner and entrepreneur, creating and saving hundreds of American jobs.Private Sector BusinessmanChris Collins is a successful small businessman with 36 years in the private sector, saving and creating hundreds of good-paying jobs in Erie, Niagara, and Monroe counties. His current companies include-- Innate Immunotherapeutics - Pharmaceutical (Secondary Progressive MS)- Mead Supply - Equipment rental company- Oxygen Generating Systems Intl. (OGSI) - Oxygen generation machinery- Schlyer Machine - Custom design of vivarium cage and bottle washers- Volland Electric - Electric repair shop, crane & hoist and electrical distributor- ZeptoMetrix Corporation - Biotechnology (infectious disease)The key to success at all of these companies is the implementation of Lean Six Sigma, which drives efficiency and quality.The Congressman began his professional career with Westinghouse Electric in 1972, spending eleven years with the company in various positions of increasing responsibility including Manager of the Westinghouse Gear Division. When Westinghouse announced it was closing its Buffalo facility, Collins purchased the assets of the Gear Division and founded Niagara Falls based industrial gear manufacturer Nutall Gear Corporation in 1983.Erie County ExecutiveIn 2007, Chris Collins was elected Erie County Executive despite a voter enrollment of almost two Democrats for every one Republican. He took over the largest county in Upstate New York with a $1.2 billion budget and 5,000+ employees. At the time, Erie County was effectively bankrupt; having a state imposed control board, no cash surplus, runaway debt, and many roads, bridges, parks, and beaches inoperative. Remarkably, Collins' business mentality and implementation of Lean Six Sigma resulted in a staggering turnaround for Erie County. In 4 years, Erie was transformed from a county in the worst financial shape of any county in New York State to one with financial prospects and upward trajectory. During his tenure, Collins' accomplishments included-- Reduced overall debt by over $120 million- Created a cash surplus in excess of $100 million- Reduced county employment by over 1,200 employees (22%) saving $72 million per year- Reopened every bridge, road, park and beach that was closed and even rebuilt the historic toboggan runs- One of the few large counties to fully pay state imposed pension costs without borrowing- Got rid of the State imposed fiscal control authority in 18 months and got approval for a 4 year plan (2012-2015) that would further reduce county debt by another $100 millionLeadership in times of emergencyIn February 2008, Erie County experienced a Hepatitis A emergency when an infected employee handled produce at a popular supermarket.  Over the course of several days, the County vaccinated and inoculated 10,000 people to protect the public.  The event was one of the largest vaccination events in the history of the United States.One year later, tragedy struck Erie County when Continental Flight 3407 crashed in a residential neighborhood, killing all 49 passengers and crew on board, and one person on the ground in Clarence Center.  Collins was one of the first public officials on the ground and immediately declared the situation a State of Emergency. Throughout the night and over the next several days, Collins worked to ensure the cooperation of Erie County departments and other government agencies in the recovery, investigation and family support efforts.In the summer of 2009, flooding devastated Southern regions of Erie County. Dozens of homeowners lost the contents of their basements and first floors.  Collins mobilized the County's Emergency Services and Public Works departments to assist local governments in their recovery efforts.  Erie County also successfully lobbied the Federal government to provide FEMA aid dollars to both local governments and individual homeowners.PersonalChris lives in Clarence, NY with his wife Mary.

She is the senior-most woman in the House and the longest-serving woman from Ohio in history. Congresswoman Kaptur ranks among the most senior Members of the 115th Congress.She is a Polish-American with humble, working class roots. Her family operated a small grocery store and her mother later served on the original organizing committee of a trade union at the Champion Spark Plug factory in Toledo.In 1981, while pursuing a doctorate in urban planning and development finance at MIT, she was recruited by the Lucas County Democratic Party to run for Congress against a first-term Republican. Although she was outspent by a 3-to-1 margin, Kaptur parlayed a strong economic message during the 1982 recession to stage a nationally-recognized upset.In Washington, Kaptur fought vigorously to win a seat on the House Appropriations Committee. Today she is the ranking member on the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, which is fitting given that the Ninth District hugs the Lake Erie coastline from Cleveland to Toledo.Congresswoman Kaptur also is the first Democratic woman ever to serve on the powerful Defense Subcommittee. There, she is a strong advocate for national security, energy independence and adequate support for the armed forces.She is also a member of the Interior Subcommittee where she fights for clean water programs that protect our Great Lakes. Earlier in her congressional career, she served on the Appropriations Financial Services Subcommittee as well as the Banking Committee. She served on the Budget Committee as recently as the 112th Congress.Born into a family steeped in patriotism and military service, Congresswoman Kaptur has made support for America's seniors, including veterans, the touchstone of her career in Congress. That dedication was displayed during the long legislative battle she waged to have a World War II memorial built on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The idea came from Roger Durbin, a constituent who had fought in World War II. Congresswoman Kaptur worked together with Mr. Durbin to make his dream a reality. Despite many setbacks and detours, she never relented.Seventeen years later, on a sunny May 29, 2004, Congresswoman Kaptur spoke as a crowd estimated at 150,000 people, including three presidents, gathered for the long-awaited dedication of the National World War II Memorial. ""What a privilege it has been to carry this dream forward for 17 years"" she said.President George W. Bush accepted the memorial on behalf of the American people, calling it a ""fitting tribute, open and expansive, like America- grand and enduring, like the achievements we honor.""Roger Durbin had died four years earlier, but he was remembered and honored prominently during the ceremony. The memorial today is one of the most popular and beloved attractions in Washington, D.C. World War II veterans, now in their mid-eighties and nineties, are treated as heroes there every day.Congresswoman Kaptur's effort on the memorial and her advocacy on behalf of veterans led the Veterans of Foreign Wars to honor her with their prestigious Americanism Award. She has also received the Prisoner of War ""Barbed Wire"" Award for her commitment to veterans' affairs.She championed the cause of workers who got sick after exposure to beryllium by guiding a major piece of legislation to passage on their behalf. She has secured funding for a pathbreaking study into the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorders and other mental health issues among our armed forces. And she helped lead a community effort to save the 180th Fighter Wing in Toledo when it was threatened by the base closure commission.Congresswoman Kaptur has always shown strong interest in America's standing in the world and its relations with other countries.She currently serves on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China and co-chairs the Congressional Hungarian Caucus and also the Ukraine Caucus.A strong supporter of Middle East peace, she directed the first surplus farm commodities in 1999 to support the peace process in Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

St. Ursula Academy named Kaptur Alumna of the Year in 1995.She is recipient of the Taubman College Distinguished Alumna award from the University of Michigan, making her the first woman so recognized and the first graduate of the Urban and Regional Planning Program to be so honored. Kaptur recently received the Director's Award from the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University for her commitment to increased understanding and appreciation of the peoples and cultures of Eurasia, Russia and East Europe.She was named the National Mental Health Association's ""Legislator of the Year"" for her championing mental health and received the 2002 Ellis Island Medal of Honor.Dedicated to the principle that fiscal responsibility begins in ""one's own backyard"" Congresswoman Kaptur has consistently returned money to the federal Treasury.

Barletta proudly represents the people of Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District.  He began his fourth term on January 3, 2017.Rep. Barletta was first sworn in on January 5, 2011. He currently serves on three House committees- the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where he serves as the Chairman of the Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management Subcommittee; the House Homeland Security Committee, where he serves on the Counterterrorism and Intelligence subcommittee; and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, where he serves on both the Higher Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee, and the Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee.    In January 2014, Rep. Barletta was named a member of a special panel of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to focus on the use of and opportunities for public-private partnerships (P3s) across all modes of transportation, economic development, public buildings, and infrastructure.  Illegal immigration is a very important issue for Rep. Barletta, who first tackled the problem when he was mayor of Hazleton, Pennsylvania.  He was the first mayor in the country to introduce and sign into law local ordinances cracking down against businesses that knowingly hire illegal aliens, and has since become a national figure in the fight against illegal immigration.Born and raised in Hazleton, Representative Barletta majored in elementary education as a student at Bloomsburg State College (now Bloomsburg University). He left school to try out for a Major League Baseball team, but was released when the team's management discovered he couldn't hit a curve ball.After he returned to Northeastern Pennsylvania, he and his wife Mary Grace started a business together. For $29.95, the Barlettas formed a line-painting business. Through hard work and perseverance, they grew that business into the largest of its kind in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania within five years. They eventually grew it to be the sixth-largest business of its kind in the entire nation.As a small business owner, Representative Barletta saw how government regulation and taxes could affect the bottom line. Even though he had very little interest in politics, he decided to run for a slot on Hazleton City Council. He was first elected to council in 1998, then was elected mayor in 2000.Despite inheriting a massive budget shortfall, he was able to turn around the City of Hazleton with tough, fiscally responsible decisions. This turnaround earned statewide praise and recognition.In addition, his leadership on the issue of illegal immigration in Hazleton garnered national attention. By ever-increasing margins of victory, Representative Barletta was elected mayor three times.In September 2004, Representative Barletta was appointed by the White House to serve on the United Nation Advisory Committee of Local Authorities as the representative of the United States of America.In November 2010, Representative Barletta was elected to Congress on his third attempt. He was re-elected in November 2012, and again in November 2014 as well as November 2016.Rep. Barletta and his wife Mary Grace live in Hazleton. They are the parents of four grown daughters- Kelly, April, Lindsey, and Grace, and have eight grandchildren- Gabriel Louis, Madeleine Grace, Julia Mae, Christopher Joseph, Reagan Marie, Jordan Louis, Anabelle Marie, and Ryan Louis."

Diane's faith in America's promise was shaped from an early age. The middle daughter of Great Depression era parents, Diane spent the earliest years of her life in public housing and, upon the encouragement of a high school guidance counselor, would go on to become the first person in her family to attain a college education. Named among the 25 most influential women in Congress by Roll Call, Black was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 and represents Tennessee's 6th district, comprised of 19 counties across middle Tennessee. Prior to that, Black served in the Tennessee state legislature, where she built her legacy on fighting back against a state income tax proposal and successfully passing legislation to make home healthcare more accessible for Tennessee seniors.In Congress, Black served as Chairman of the House Budget Committee from January 2017 to January 2018,  where she worked alongside her colleagues to draft budget resolutions that root out wasteful spending and confront the drivers of our crippling $20 trillion debt burden in Washington. Black is a firm believer that getting America's fiscal house in order also requires serious reforms of the broken Congressional budget process. That is why she has cosponsored legislation proposing a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution and has cosponsored the No Budget, No Pay Act, which withholds pay from Congress if an annual budget is not passed by the legal deadline.Through her over 40 years of experience working in the health care field, Black learned first-hand about the importance of high-quality care and the obstacles faced by patients, health care providers and employers. Black's real world experiences as a nurse have uniquely positioned her as a credible and effective leader on health care policy in Congress. She is focused on fully repealing the president's disastrous health care law and advancing true market-based, patient-centered reforms that will bring down the rising cost of care by increasing private sector competition and consumer choice.In 2011, Black was the first member of Congress to have legislation signed into law that repeals a health care provision in Obamacare, which saved taxpayers $13 billion dollars. Through her work as House Budget Committee Chair, Black is leading the effort to fully repeal the President's healthcare law and offer a conservative, patient-centered replacement.Black also serves on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee and has quickly established herself as a leader in the efforts to overhaul the U.S. tax code for the first time in 30 years, which was signed into law by President Trump in December 2017. The bill instituted a flatter, fairer and simpler tax code to help create the conditions for economic growth, job creation, and higher wages for American workers.A former Tennessee Right to Life legislator of the year, Black is a steadfast champion for the rights of the unborn. The first bill that she introduced as a member of Congress would have defunded Planned Parenthood in a short-term spending bill. Since that time Black also authored and fought for the House passage of the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, a more comprehensive bill to block all federal funding for the nation's largest abortion provider. Black additionally sponsored the Conscience Protection Act, legislation that would protect the religious freedom of entities that refuse to perform, pay for, or refer abortions.Black's staunch fiscal conservatism earned her the prestigious ""Award for Conservative Excellence"" from the American Conservative Union and the ""Freedom Fighter"" award from FreedomWorks, among other honors.  She and her husband of over 35 years, Dr. David Black, have three grown children and six grandchildren. They live in Gallatin and attend Community Church in Hendersonville."

This would be the first in a long line of votes during his career that would define his legislative philosophy- fighting to ensure the basic human rights of every American, such as access to health care.During his 24 years in the Tennessee State Senate, Congressman Cohen amassed a strong record of passionate, honest and unselfish service. He consistently spurned special interests to stand up for the people's interests. In 1984, he drafted and passed a resolution creating one of the first state Holocaust Commissions in America to educate others about and to commemorate the Holocaust. On issues ranging from civil rights to funding for the arts to women's rights to animal welfare, Congressman Cohen was a relentless advocate in the Tennessee State Senate even in the face of overwhelming opposition. Before he was elected to Congress, he became known throughout the state as the ""Father of the Tennessee Lottery"" after leading the referendum effort that instituted arguably the most successful education initiative in Tennessee history.Since the inception of the Tennessee Education Lottery Scholarship program in 2004, over $4 billion has gone to students continuing their education at the college level. As a State Senator, Congressman Cohen fought for nearly twenty years before the State Lottery was established. Countless students have benefited from Congressman Cohen's tireless efforts to provide Tennesseans with access to affordable, quality, post-secondary education. Upon election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006, Congressman Cohen immediately distinguished himself on the Hill for his thoughtful legislation and quick wit. He also quickly earned a reputation as a champion of civil rights and justice on the highly influential Judiciary Committee, with then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi referring to him as the ""conscience of the freshman class"" in 2008. That same year, he was instrumental in passing the first-of-its-kind House resolution apologizing for the enslavement and racial segregation of African Americans. Congressman Cohen has remained a steadfast leader on issues of importance to the people of the 9th District, working closely with former President Barack Obama and leading the policy debate on issues like infant mortality, universal health care, the economy, crime and criminal rehabilitation, veterans issues, transportation and infrastructure, and of course, education. His persistence and hard work has paid off with a $30 million Choice Neighborhood grant to redevelop and revitalize Foote Homes and surrounding areas, a  $15 million TIGER grant to create jobs and fund the Main Street to Main Street Connector Project to make major improvements to the Main Street corridor as well as connect to West Memphis with the Big River Crossing pedestrian and bike trail along the Harahan Bridge, an additional $9 million in the federal budget and a $2 million dollar federal grant to the city of Memphis to help reduce the backlog of untested sexual assault kits that could catch predators and prevent crime, and many other projects and policies. Congressman Cohen also lead the effort in Congress for the state of Tennessee to receive a guarantee disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotment totaling more than $530 million over the next 10 years to help the state's hospitals and community health centers recoup expenses incurred caring for those who cannot afford to pay.In November of 2015, Congressman Cohen was named a member of the Highway Bill Conference Committee where he worked with his colleagues from the House and Senate to craft the first bipartisan, long-term surface transportation bill in a decade to improve our nation's infrastructure. In May 2016, Congressman Cohen was named a member of the Opioids Package Conference Committee where he worked to address the opioids crisis in the United States. In January of 2017, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi appointed Congressman Cohen to serve on the powerful House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee to set the Democratic policy agenda and nominate Democratic Members for committee assignments. In February 2017, Leader Pelosi appointed Congressman Cohen to serve on the House Ethics Committee. President Obama nominated several of Congressman Cohen's recommendations for federal positions, including Judges John Fowlkes, Sheryl Lipman and Bernice Donald, U.S. Attorney Edward Stanton III, and TVA Board Members V. Lynn Evans, Ron Walter and Bishop William Graves, who have all been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Congressman Cohen has been named the 35th most effective Democratic lawmaker by the Center for Effective Lawmaking at the University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University.Congressman Cohen has also dedicated himself to providing outstanding constituent service to the citizens of Memphis. The doors of his District Office in the Clifford Davis/Odell Horton Federal Building are always open for constituents, and Congressman Cohen held more than a dozen town halls around the city which often included visiting leaders such as Judiciary Committee Ranking Member John Conyers (MI-14) and singer/activist Harry Belafonte. He has never faltered in fighting for those who do not have the power bestowed by wealth and advantage, and his goal is as it has always been- to ensure that everyone - regardless of race, class or creed - has the opportunity to achieve their American dream."

McCaul is currently serving his seventh term representing Texas' 10th District in the United States Congress. The 10th Congressional District of Texas stretches from Austin to the Houston suburbs, and includes Austin, Bastrop, Colorado, Fayette, Harris, Lee, Travis, Washington and Waller Counties.Homeland Security ChairmanOn January 3, 2013 - the beginning of the 113th Congress - Congressman McCaul became Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security.  The Committee has oversight of the Department of Homeland Security ensuring it is able to carry out its core mission of protecting the American people from terrorist attacks.  As Chairman, McCaul will prioritize the threat of international and domestic terrorism, cyber security, airport security and fixing dysfunctional management within DHS which contributes to wasted taxpayer dollars, delayed security operations and corruption.  Chairman McCaul will also prioritize border security and elevate this as a national security issue.Congressman McCaul is also the Chairman of the U.S.-Mexico Inter-Parliamentary Group (I.P.G.) Every year the Group meets to discuss issues and events involving the two nations. These meetings give both American and Mexican lawmakers the opportunity to address the challenges facing our two countries.He also serves on the Committee on Foreign Affairs working to ensure our national security is strong.Washington ReformerCongressman McCaul has a strong track record as a leading fiscal conservative in the Congress.  He never forgets that every dollar the Congress appropriates is the People's money, not the government's.  As such, Congressman McCaul has fought against the failed $787 billion stimulus, the $700 billion bailout, the Cap and Trade national energy tax and the Affordable Care Act. In addition to his conservative voting record, Congressman McCaul led the charge against earmarks, which was adopted as the official policy of the House of Representatives during the 112th Congress.In recognition of his pro-growth, pro-jobs voting record, Congressman McCaul has been awarded the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Spirit of Enterprise Award each year he has served.  Congressman Michael McCaul's stand against unprecedented government expansion and out of control spending has also been recognized by the American Conservative Union, which presented McCaul its coveted ACU Ratings Award.High Tech LeadershipWith many NASA employees, universities and high tech companies in the 10th District, Congressman McCaul's service on the Committee on Science and Technology provides him the ability to enhance Texas' role as a global leader in technology.Congressman McCaul is co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional High Tech Caucus and the Cybersecurity Caucus.  In 2008, Rep. McCaul co-chaired the Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency which, along with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), developed and presented recommendations to President Obama to secure cyberspace and protect our national interests. The Information Technology Industry Council awarded Congressman McCaul its coveted Legislator of the Year Award for 2009 for his support of congressional policies that benefit American technology companies.  TechNet, the bipartisan political network of CEOs that promotes the growth of the innovation economy, also awarded Congressman McCaul its annual Founders Circle Award, one of four members of Congress recognized by the organization for their outstanding leadership to champion the nation's innovation economy.Fighting Childhood CancerIn the 112th Congress, McCaul's legislation, the Creating Hope Act, was signed by the president and became law in October 2012, creating incentives for pharmaceutical companies to create new treatments for pediatric cancer patients.  McCaul co-chairs the Congressional Childhood Cancer Caucus, which he founded shortly after he was first elected to Congress.PersonalPrior to Congress, Michael McCaul served as Chief of Counter Terrorism and National Security in the U.S. Attorney's office, Western District of Texas, and led the Joint Terrorism Task Force charged with detecting, deterring and preventing terrorist activity.  McCaul also served as Texas Deputy Attorney General under current U.S. Senator John Cornyn, and served as a federal prosecutor in the Department of Justice's Public Integrity Section in Washington, D.C.

Elected to her 11th term in 2016 by an overwhelming margin, Kay has earned her reputation in Congress as a hard-working, tough and principled leader on the issues that matter most to the people she serves. Her legislative prowess and ability to get things done, widely respected by both policy makers and influencers in Washington alike, led to her recognition by CQ's Roll Call as one of the 25 Most Influential Women in Congress.The first and only Republican woman to represent Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives, Granger currently serves as Chairwoman of the powerful Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, which handles over 50 percent of all Appropriations Committee funding. As Chairwoman, Kay is committed to rebuilding America's military and taking care of our service members and their families. Her top priority is to address the readiness crisis in our military and reverse the harmful, arbitrary budget cuts to our nation's defense. In these dangerous times, Kay understands that for our country to be safe, we must be strong.Granger has received numerous honors for her leadership on national defense issues. Most recently, she accepted the 2016 Henry M. Scoop Jackson Distinguished Service Award presented by the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs for her unwavering commitment throughout her career for a robust military capability for the U.S. and its allies. Granger was also awarded the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award and the Department of the Army's Decoration for Distinguished Civilian Service. These honors are the top recognitions given to civilians by the secretary of the Navy and secretary of the Army.To promote global security, Kay served as Chairwoman of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee. In this role, she oversaw State Department and security programs abroad where she insisted on transparency and accountability including in the probe on the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi. She has also been a champion for the Israeli missile defense systems, which help protect the State of Israel from constant threats it faces from adversaries in the region. Her staunch support of Israel and strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship led her to be recognized for her role in helping get the 10-year, $38 billion memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the two countries completed in 2016.   During the 2014 national security and humanitarian crisis resulting from the influx of more than 58,000 displaced children at the U.S.-Mexico border, Granger was selected to chair the task force to address the challenges created by the crisis. Granger was also the first to call for oversight hearings to respond to the Ebola outbreak in the United States and was instrumental in creating a bipartisan Congressional task force to combat the global rise of anti-Semitism.Kay has also been recognized for her humanitarian efforts, being named the U.S. Agency for International Development's 2014 Champion in the Global Fight Against Tuberculosis and receiving Malaria No More's Malaria Vision Award in 2015. In attacking the immoral practice of human trafficking, she has provided greater stability in volatile parts of the world while disrupting recruitment efforts and funding sources for terrorist organizations.Her work to end the poaching of black rhinos and elephants in the wild led the World Wildlife Fund to award her the title of Conservation Champion. Granger's work in this area sharply reduced the sale of rhino horns, which terrorists and other criminals sell to fund their activities worldwide. For her efforts, she was honored as a Conservation Hero by Conservation International in 2014.In recognition of her achievements, Kay was elected to the Texas Women's Hall of Fame and the Fort Worth Business Hall of Fame. Additional honors she has received include the National Federation of Independent Business' Champion of Small Business Award; the Texas Association of Business' Bob Bolen Champion of Free Enterprise Lifetime Achievement Award; as well as Texas Wesleyan University's Law Sone Medal.Born in Greenville, Texas and raised in Fort Worth, Kay never intended to become involved in politics. Majoring in education, Kay graduated from Texas Wesleyan University and became a high school journalism and English teacher. In 1978, she opened and successfully operated her own insurance agency before becoming involved in the political process because of some local issues impacting her community.Kay's public service began as a member of the Fort Worth Zoning Commission, and she was then elected as the first female Mayor of Fort Worth in 1991. Under Kay's strong leadership, Fort Worth's economy grew; crime was reduced by 49 percent; and the city was recognized with a coveted All-America City Award in 1993. Kay - a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution - returns home to the district every weekend to meet with constituents in person and talk with them about what is going on in Washington.

The Castro family's history in the United States began nearly 100 years ago when his grandmother, Victoria Castro, came to Texas as a young orphan. In the spirit of the American Dream, she often worked two and three jobs at a time to be able to give her daughter (Joaquin's mother, Rosie) and her grandchildren a better chance in life.Joaquin has worked hard to seize the opportunities created by the sacrifices of his grandmother and prior generations. After finishing high school a year early, Joaquin left San Antonio to graduate with honors from Stanford University in 1996. He then went on to attend Harvard Law School where he received his Juris Doctorate degree in 2000. Upon his return to San Antonio at 28 years old, Joaquin joined a private law practice and was elected to the Texas Legislature. He served five terms as state representative for District 125. In 2012, Joaquin was elected to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives as representative of Texas' 20th Congressional District, which covers a large portion of San Antonio and Bexar County. Joaquin's identical twin brother, Julian Castro, was elected in 2013 to his third term as Mayor of San Antonio. On July 28, 2014, Julian Castro was sworn in as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Joaquin's respect for public service developed at a young age and was deeply influenced by his parents' involvement in political movements and civic causes. His father, a retired teacher, and his mother, a renowned community activist, instilled in him a deep appreciation for the democratic process and the importance of serving one's community.Despite a difficult political environment during his time as state legislator, Joaquin transcended partisan gridlock to help restore millions of dollars in funding to critical health care and education programs.
